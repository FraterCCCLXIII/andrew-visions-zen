1
00:00:01,022 --> 00:00:02,625
Speaker 1: So I want to speak a little bit about my

2
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:05,310
Speaker 1: understanding of the nature of the soul as

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,953
Speaker 1: it relates to the awakened, to enlightened

4
00:00:06,993 --> 00:00:15,405
Speaker 1: awareness, and keep in mind that when we

5
00:00:15,445 --> 00:00:19,049
Speaker 1: are speaking about such deep matters and

6
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:22,433
Speaker 1: the soul is a very deep matter we're

7
00:00:22,473 --> 00:00:25,956
Speaker 1: entering into speculative inquiry.

8
00:00:27,198 --> 00:00:29,079
Speaker 1: So I'm going to share with you my personal

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,949
Speaker 1: understanding, what I've come to but it's

10
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,513
Speaker 1: all a work in progress, remains a work in

11
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:35,933
Speaker 1: progress.

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,203
Speaker 1: I'm a work in progress, my ideas are a work

13
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:42,528
Speaker 1: in progress, but I think some of the

14
00:00:42,608 --> 00:00:45,874
Speaker 1: distinctions I'm going to try and make some

15
00:00:45,914 --> 00:00:46,835
Speaker 1: of you might find helpful.

16
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:57,447
Speaker 1: So, just to be clear, because I'm a teacher

17
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:58,768
Speaker 1: of enlightenment, everything that I speak

18
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:02,872
Speaker 1: about relates to the metaphysical context

19
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:08,517
Speaker 1: of the highest spiritual transformation,

20
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:14,530
Speaker 1: the most profound shift in consciousness

21
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,981
Speaker 1: that we know about, when it leads to

22
00:01:17,923 --> 00:01:21,491
Speaker 1: unimaginable liberation and inner freedom

23
00:01:22,353 --> 00:01:27,152
Speaker 1: and joy and happiness, contentment.

24
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:33,230
Speaker 1: So I'll speak.

25
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:41,153
Speaker 1: I want to describe a simple map, a way to

26
00:01:41,193 --> 00:01:43,583
Speaker 1: understand this, a way to help you

27
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:45,849
Speaker 1: understand these distinctions in the

28
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,192
Speaker 1: context in which I'm speaking about it.

29
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:56,847
Speaker 1: So the soul, in the way we use the word,

30
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:01,296
Speaker 1: usually refers to one of the deepest parts

31
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,220
Speaker 1: of our humanity.

32
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,906
Speaker 1: One of the deepest parts of our humanity

33
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,011
Speaker 1: when we usually refer to our soul, or the

34
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:17,343
Speaker 1: soul, we're referring to a level of

35
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:18,326
Speaker 1: emotional and spiritual depth that is

36
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,009
Speaker 1: inherently meaningful.

37
00:02:21,522 --> 00:02:22,968
Speaker 1: When people start speaking about the soul,

38
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,245
Speaker 1: we know that they're not speaking about

39
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:25,028
Speaker 1: superficial matters.

40
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,063
Speaker 1: They're speaking about matters that are

41
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:28,591
Speaker 1: deep and sincere and serious.

42
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,352
Speaker 1: So I want to talk about the nature of the

43
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:39,131
Speaker 1: soul in relationship to enlightenment.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,845
Speaker 1: So we want to start with looking at the

45
00:02:56,865 --> 00:02:58,556
Speaker 1: nature of the ego.

46
00:02:58,576 --> 00:02:59,220
Speaker 1: The ego is the frontal cell.

47
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:04,369
Speaker 1: The ego plays a dominant role in the

48
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:07,054
Speaker 1: formation of the self-structure.

49
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:15,650
Speaker 1: It, the ego, is the organizing principle in

50
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:16,079
Speaker 1: the psyche.

51
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,388
Speaker 1: It creates coherence.

52
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,366
Speaker 1: So it's just to speak in very broad,

53
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:25,228
Speaker 1: general terms.

54
00:03:27,392 --> 00:03:31,380
Speaker 1: If the ego is that structure in the psyche

55
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,446
Speaker 1: that creates coherence or a sense of

56
00:03:34,486 --> 00:03:37,371
Speaker 1: wholeness, then we want that structure, the

57
00:03:37,411 --> 00:03:38,714
Speaker 1: ego structure, to be in good shape.

58
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,524
Speaker 1: We want it to be healthy and vibrant and

59
00:03:40,564 --> 00:03:44,822
Speaker 1: strong and coherent, because we all know

60
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:47,430
Speaker 1: that when the ego structure is not coherent

61
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,727
Speaker 1: or is incoherent, then usually the person

62
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:52,913
Speaker 1: is in trouble of some kind.

63
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,184
Speaker 1: So the ego is.

64
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:57,729
Speaker 1: The ego very much relates to the.

65
00:03:58,521 --> 00:03:59,706
Speaker 1: In the way that I'm speaking about it now,

66
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,065
Speaker 1: very much relates to the structure of the

67
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:04,225
Speaker 1: personality and in the way I'm speaking

68
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,330
Speaker 1: about it now, we can interchangeably use

69
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:13,384
Speaker 1: the word ego to mean, in this context, the

70
00:04:13,424 --> 00:04:15,121
Speaker 1: nature of Andrew's personality, the nature

71
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:18,091
Speaker 1: of Andrew's ego, for example, in the way

72
00:04:18,111 --> 00:04:19,282
Speaker 1: I'm speaking about it now, I'm not speaking

73
00:04:19,322 --> 00:04:22,985
Speaker 1: about the ego as a demon, because often in

74
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:27,741
Speaker 1: Enlightenment contexts, the ego is the

75
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:29,707
Speaker 1: demon that we need to transcend in order to

76
00:04:29,747 --> 00:04:31,994
Speaker 1: be spiritually liberated, which is also

77
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:33,941
Speaker 1: true, but that's not the context in which

78
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:36,027
Speaker 1: I'm speaking about it for this talk.

79
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:39,839
Speaker 1: So, for this talk, we want to understand

80
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:40,080
Speaker 1: the ego.

81
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,950
Speaker 1: Structure is the is that structure that

82
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,233
Speaker 1: coheres to personality.

83
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,692
Speaker 1: It creates a healthy, integrated frontal

84
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:52,024
Speaker 1: self, what Ken Wilber would call the

85
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:52,606
Speaker 1: frontal self.

86
00:04:58,542 --> 00:04:59,821
Speaker 1: And just to add to that, of course, the ego

87
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,190
Speaker 1: can have positive expressions and negative

88
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:03,772
Speaker 1: expressions.

89
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:07,525
Speaker 1: It can be a positive ego and a negative ego,

90
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:12,374
Speaker 1: a happy ego and a sad ego, a joyous ego and

91
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,990
Speaker 1: an angry ego, a liberated ego and a

92
00:05:17,612 --> 00:05:18,413
Speaker 1: victimized ego.

93
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:20,865
Speaker 1: I'm sure you all know what I'm talking

94
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:22,370
Speaker 1: about from your own experience.

95
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:26,752
Speaker 1: You all know what I'm talking about from

96
00:05:26,772 --> 00:05:27,153
Speaker 1: your own experience.

97
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:34,452
Speaker 1: But the ego, the ego is not the deepest

98
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:40,932
Speaker 1: part of the self, and so whenever we hear

99
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:45,390
Speaker 1: people refer to the soul, refer to my, I

100
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,575
Speaker 1: feel it in my soul.

101
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:50,791
Speaker 1: I could feel it in my soul, I could feel it

102
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:51,192
Speaker 1: in her soul.

103
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:54,019
Speaker 1: We were always pointing, when we speak that

104
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,371
Speaker 1: way, we were generally pointing to a deeper

105
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,455
Speaker 1: structure in the self, a deeper structure

106
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:02,846
Speaker 1: than the frontal self, a deeper structure

107
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:05,137
Speaker 1: than the personality, than the egoic

108
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:06,783
Speaker 1: personality, referring to a deeper

109
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:09,294
Speaker 1: dimension of the self that generally is

110
00:06:09,314 --> 00:06:11,843
Speaker 1: considered to be more authentic and carry

111
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:15,292
Speaker 1: more truth, whatever that means.

112
00:06:16,921 --> 00:06:19,387
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that usually, when we

113
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:22,463
Speaker 1: ourselves refer to our own souls or the

114
00:06:22,504 --> 00:06:25,224
Speaker 1: soul of another, we're referring to deeper

115
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:31,210
Speaker 1: dimensions of the self than is the ego or

116
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,333
Speaker 1: the parental personality.

117
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,149
Speaker 1: He has a very deep soul, she is a deep soul,

118
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:44,554
Speaker 1: she's an old soul, for example.

119
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:46,804
Speaker 1: She is a deep soul, she's an old soul, for

120
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,067
Speaker 1: example.

121
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:49,189
Speaker 1: So I was talking about the nature of the

122
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,913
Speaker 1: ego, the soul and the true self.

123
00:06:56,726 --> 00:06:58,768
Speaker 1: And the true self is from a spiritual

124
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:00,110
Speaker 1: perspective, from a metaphysical

125
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,073
Speaker 1: perspective, from the perspective of the

126
00:07:03,113 --> 00:07:03,974
Speaker 1: perennial philosophy.

127
00:07:03,994 --> 00:07:10,001
Speaker 1: The true self is the deepest dimension of

128
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:11,406
Speaker 1: the self, and the deepest dimension of

129
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:26,279
Speaker 1: reality itself relates to our personal

130
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:26,440
Speaker 1: history.

131
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:32,049
Speaker 1: The soul relates to, I believe, all the

132
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:33,733
Speaker 1: experience we've ever had as an evolving

133
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:42,575
Speaker 1: soul or, if one would believe it or think

134
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:43,499
Speaker 1: that way, over many lifetimes.

135
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:46,254
Speaker 1: And the self, the true self, exists from an

136
00:07:46,294 --> 00:07:47,761
Speaker 1: inner realm of dimension of reality that is

137
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:49,586
Speaker 1: timeless and formless and beginning and

138
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:51,471
Speaker 1: endless and ultimately eternal.

139
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,065
Speaker 1: And remember, when I'm speaking about the

140
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,880
Speaker 1: ego and the soul and the true self, I'm

141
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,809
Speaker 1: speaking about myself, I'm speaking about

142
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,271
Speaker 1: yourself.

143
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:07,460
Speaker 1: So when we make these kinds of distinctions,

144
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:09,326
Speaker 1: we don't want to get too abstract about it,

145
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:11,242
Speaker 1: but we want to relate to, we want to try

146
00:08:11,262 --> 00:08:17,187
Speaker 1: and locate the sense of being, the sense of

147
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:19,019
Speaker 1: being an ego or a unique personality,

148
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:23,111
Speaker 1: within ourself.

149
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,502
Speaker 1: As we're on an inquiry like this, we want

150
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:33,327
Speaker 1: to find our own ego and we want to find our

151
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:37,028
Speaker 1: own soul, which is a good thing to find.

152
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,479
Speaker 1: People that haven't found their own souls

153
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:46,526
Speaker 1: are generally not in great shape and, for

154
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:48,141
Speaker 1: the seekers after enlightenment, we want to

155
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:49,266
Speaker 1: find our true self.

156
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,646
Speaker 1: Our true self is the part of ourself,

157
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:54,950
Speaker 1: because it is one with eternity.

158
00:08:55,721 --> 00:08:59,734
Speaker 1: It's a place where we find unconditional

159
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:03,268
Speaker 1: freedom, because it's a place where time

160
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:03,990
Speaker 1: does not exist.

161
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,182
Speaker 1: The true self is a source of spiritual

162
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:16,085
Speaker 1: freedom, yeah, inner freedom, spiritual

163
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:16,746
Speaker 1: liberation.

164
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:23,675
Speaker 1: So the ego is the source of the feelings of

165
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:27,600
Speaker 1: being a unique personal entity.

166
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:35,201
Speaker 1: It's a place where we experience pride, the

167
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:41,617
Speaker 1: experience of the process that most of us

168
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,106
Speaker 1: find ourselves in the midst of, of having a

169
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:45,370
Speaker 1: personal experience.

170
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,667
Speaker 1: It's when experience it happens in time,

171
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,366
Speaker 1: it's when experience feels very personal

172
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:53,169
Speaker 1: and unique to me.

173
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:57,327
Speaker 1: The ego is the source of this feeling of a

174
00:09:57,849 --> 00:09:59,584
Speaker 1: personal process, of a personal event

175
00:09:59,624 --> 00:09:59,966
Speaker 1: happening.

176
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:03,669
Speaker 1: That's the self-structure in which feels,

177
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:07,026
Speaker 1: in which the experience of embodied

178
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:08,822
Speaker 1: consciousness is experienced as being a

179
00:10:08,862 --> 00:10:11,205
Speaker 1: personal event, something that's happening

180
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:12,610
Speaker 1: to a unique self of me.

181
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:18,963
Speaker 1: So I always like to say that the soul, what

182
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:22,288
Speaker 1: I'm calling the soul, is the deepest part

183
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:24,700
Speaker 1: of the self that's still personal.

184
00:10:27,021 --> 00:10:28,262
Speaker 1: So the soul is the deepest part of the self

185
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:29,563
Speaker 1: that's still personal.

186
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,124
Speaker 1: So the soul comes from a much deeper source

187
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:33,386
Speaker 1: and I like to refer to the soul as the

188
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,308
Speaker 1: metaphysical organ.

189
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:38,169
Speaker 1: We could call it that, for lack of a better

190
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:39,970
Speaker 1: way of putting it.

191
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,771
Speaker 1: The soul is a metaphysical organ that

192
00:10:46,234 --> 00:10:46,914
Speaker 1: carries with it.

193
00:10:46,954 --> 00:10:48,555
Speaker 1: If you believe in the continuity of

194
00:10:48,595 --> 00:10:51,958
Speaker 1: consciousness and I very much believe I

195
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:54,901
Speaker 1: can't prove it to you, but I very much

196
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,647
Speaker 1: believe in the continuity of consciousness

197
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:00,193
Speaker 1: I believe that the self, or that our soul,

198
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:05,070
Speaker 1: is on a journey of becoming in the context

199
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,399
Speaker 1: of evolution, just so, just with the rest

200
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:08,980
Speaker 1: of the cosmos.

201
00:11:11,346 --> 00:11:14,634
Speaker 1: So the soul would be the receptacle which

202
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:16,499
Speaker 1: would contain all the memories of all the

203
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,326
Speaker 1: experiences you've ever had, going back to

204
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:20,710
Speaker 1: the very beginning of time and even the

205
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,552
Speaker 1: beginning of the universe.

206
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:25,170
Speaker 1: I believe that when I say it's something I

207
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,043
Speaker 1: believe, it's something that I'm.

208
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:27,604
Speaker 1: It's really a belief.

209
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:28,447
Speaker 1: I can't prove to you.

210
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,689
Speaker 1: But the soul is the metaphysical vessel

211
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:36,980
Speaker 1: that remains a constant and that is, I

212
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,668
Speaker 1: believe, in a process of growth and

213
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:42,827
Speaker 1: development through different incarnations

214
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:46,043
Speaker 1: and different processes of embodied

215
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:47,769
Speaker 1: consciousness over time.

216
00:11:58,281 --> 00:12:00,469
Speaker 1: But the soul is a place where we experience

217
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:06,252
Speaker 1: our deepest emotions, our deepest feelings

218
00:12:08,657 --> 00:12:10,362
Speaker 1: that still have a connection to our

219
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,519
Speaker 1: personal sense of self-identity.

220
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,626
Speaker 1: But these are deeper kinds of feelings.

221
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,704
Speaker 1: We could say in this context that the ego

222
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:25,289
Speaker 1: experiences all kinds of emotions and

223
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:28,244
Speaker 1: feelings, likes and dislikes.

224
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:32,992
Speaker 1: But the preferences and likes and dislikes

225
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,195
Speaker 1: of the ego in this context would be

226
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,364
Speaker 1: considered to be would be considered much

227
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:41,273
Speaker 1: more superficial in general than the

228
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,902
Speaker 1: feelings that we experience at the level of

229
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:43,643
Speaker 1: our souls.

230
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:48,272
Speaker 1: So for, for example, maybe we meet, as some

231
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:50,263
Speaker 1: people like to talk about, maybe we meet

232
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:51,167
Speaker 1: our soulmate.

233
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:57,533
Speaker 1: When I met her, I recognized

234
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:02,806
Speaker 1: instantaneously and miraculously that she

235
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,790
Speaker 1: was my soulmate and that we'd been waiting

236
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,752
Speaker 1: for each other for years.

237
00:13:05,772 --> 00:13:06,293
Speaker 1: That kind of thing.

238
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:10,224
Speaker 1: It's when we experience deeper kinds of

239
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:13,199
Speaker 1: non-superficial, deeper kinds of feelings

240
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:16,567
Speaker 1: that relate to our experience of life.

241
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:18,544
Speaker 1: But these feelings are occurring in a much

242
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:21,528
Speaker 1: deeper strata dimension of experience.

243
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:27,338
Speaker 1: We feel deeper connections and deeper

244
00:13:27,358 --> 00:13:27,518
Speaker 1: contexts.

245
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:30,482
Speaker 1: The dimension of experience we feel deeper

246
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:32,004
Speaker 1: connections and deeper contexts, maybe a

247
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:35,551
Speaker 1: deeper sense of meaning and also maybe a

248
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:36,813
Speaker 1: deeper sense of loss and grief,

249
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:42,339
Speaker 1: relationships and loss and grief.

250
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,849
Speaker 1: But the soul is the dimension of ourself

251
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,740
Speaker 1: where we experience our deepest feelings

252
00:13:46,737 --> 00:13:49,188
Speaker 1: that are still related to ourselves

253
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:50,955
Speaker 1: personally but are much deeper than the

254
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:53,081
Speaker 1: realm of the kinds of emotions we

255
00:13:53,121 --> 00:13:54,422
Speaker 1: experience at the level of the, of

256
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:55,363
Speaker 1: spiritual evolution is to train ourselves

257
00:13:55,383 --> 00:14:12,444
Speaker 1: to cease to experience life from the

258
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,875
Speaker 1: vantage point that is so superficial to a

259
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,341
Speaker 1: vantage point perspective that's much

260
00:14:16,401 --> 00:14:21,833
Speaker 1: deeper, much more authentic, much more

261
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:27,107
Speaker 1: meaningful and therefore has inherently

262
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:27,729
Speaker 1: greater value.

263
00:14:30,873 --> 00:14:32,198
Speaker 1: One feels with people that are very

264
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:33,664
Speaker 1: superficial that they're just skirting

265
00:14:33,684 --> 00:14:36,168
Speaker 1: along on the surface of life because

266
00:14:36,188 --> 00:14:37,577
Speaker 1: they're not connected to any deeper parts

267
00:14:37,637 --> 00:14:39,158
Speaker 1: of themselves or deeper parts of reality,

268
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:46,409
Speaker 1: and that can be tedious and unsatisfying

269
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:47,672
Speaker 1: for people with greater depth.

270
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,808
Speaker 1: But when you meet people who have greater

271
00:14:51,868 --> 00:14:54,006
Speaker 1: depth, you feel that you're meeting them at

272
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:58,667
Speaker 1: the level of the soul and then there seems

273
00:14:58,707 --> 00:15:02,222
Speaker 1: to be a sense of greater value in those

274
00:15:02,262 --> 00:15:03,928
Speaker 1: kinds of connections and experiences.

275
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:11,882
Speaker 1: Value, purpose, meaning gravitas, sense of

276
00:15:12,143 --> 00:15:13,948
Speaker 1: this means something of value.

277
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:14,971
Speaker 1: This is very important.

278
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:18,066
Speaker 1: This kind of feeling gives the experience

279
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:22,406
Speaker 1: of being alive value and meaning, which is

280
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:24,736
Speaker 1: so important in the human experience.

281
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:31,006
Speaker 1: Experience, value, now this, when we go

282
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:33,180
Speaker 1: deeper than that, the realm of the self,

283
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:36,626
Speaker 1: the true self that spiritual realizers

284
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:39,171
Speaker 1: refer to as the true self, that's the realm

285
00:15:39,211 --> 00:15:44,948
Speaker 1: of eternity consciousness, of non-dual

286
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:46,090
Speaker 1: eternity consciousness.

287
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:48,975
Speaker 1: So the deepest dimension of the self, which

288
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,404
Speaker 1: is synonymous with the deepest dimension of

289
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:53,111
Speaker 1: reality itself, is a place where we

290
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:59,967
Speaker 1: experience the deepest quality and

291
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:03,091
Speaker 1: experience of I-ness, of selfness, of

292
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:03,552
Speaker 1: I-ness.

293
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:06,495
Speaker 1: But at that level of depth it's completely

294
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:07,236
Speaker 1: impersonal.

295
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:11,507
Speaker 1: There's no unique characteristics or

296
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:13,793
Speaker 1: features to the true self.

297
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,246
Speaker 1: The true self is often referred to as the

298
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:18,029
Speaker 1: ground of being.

299
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:21,160
Speaker 1: So it's an eternal ground that exists

300
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,031
Speaker 1: beyond time and beyond space and beyond

301
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:26,580
Speaker 1: form and beyond conception.

302
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:29,726
Speaker 1: But it's a place where you and I experience

303
00:16:30,648 --> 00:16:33,253
Speaker 1: the fullest, deepest and most profound

304
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:36,683
Speaker 1: experience of conscious existence.

305
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:39,986
Speaker 1: But in that level we experience ourself as

306
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:42,909
Speaker 1: existing eternally, for eternity.

307
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:48,435
Speaker 1: It's a place where awareness is absolute

308
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,245
Speaker 1: and existence is, as I was saying, eternal,

309
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:55,577
Speaker 1: and it is absolutely and totally unrelated

310
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:57,670
Speaker 1: to any kind of relative experience that

311
00:16:57,977 --> 00:17:02,389
Speaker 1: your soul or that your ego has in any other

312
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:10,499
Speaker 1: kind of context, or that your ego has in

313
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:11,380
Speaker 1: any other kind of context.

314
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:18,317
Speaker 1: So we have the ego, positive and negative.

315
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:23,280
Speaker 1: We have the soul, we have the true self Now,

316
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,084
Speaker 1: the soul, which is, as I was, as I've been

317
00:17:24,104 --> 00:17:24,888
Speaker 1: saying, which is the deepest part of the

318
00:17:24,908 --> 00:17:26,375
Speaker 1: yourself and myself that's still personal.

319
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:30,261
Speaker 1: It's where we experience our deepest, our

320
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:34,501
Speaker 1: deeper and more significant feelings and

321
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:40,249
Speaker 1: preferences and fears and yearnings and

322
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:40,751
Speaker 1: values.

323
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:52,080
Speaker 1: What we experience in our soul depends upon

324
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:57,327
Speaker 1: our level of consciousness development on

325
00:17:57,387 --> 00:17:59,321
Speaker 1: one hand, and on the other hand, it depends

326
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:02,461
Speaker 1: on what we hold as being most dear or the

327
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:09,036
Speaker 1: greatest value to us hold as being most

328
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:10,000
Speaker 1: dear and one of the greatest value to us.

329
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,843
Speaker 1: So in integral philosophy, they had some

330
00:18:11,903 --> 00:18:14,351
Speaker 1: basic, basic distinctions in terms of the

331
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,487
Speaker 1: evolutionary stages that the self goes

332
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,265
Speaker 1: through, and we'll just go through the most

333
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,947
Speaker 1: most basic ones for the sake of the talk

334
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:23,801
Speaker 1: I'm giving to you here.

335
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:25,186
Speaker 1: It's tonight where you are might be morning,

336
00:18:26,741 --> 00:18:31,553
Speaker 1: but the lowest level is called egocentric

337
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,686
Speaker 1: and at the egocentric level is the

338
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:38,806
Speaker 1: consciousness of the small child, of the

339
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:44,401
Speaker 1: baby, who is completely identified with his

340
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:47,663
Speaker 1: or her biological impulses, his or her

341
00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:48,587
Speaker 1: fears and desires.

342
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:52,247
Speaker 1: It's a state of uncontained, absolute

343
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,812
Speaker 1: narcissism and self-concern.

344
00:18:59,302 --> 00:19:02,124
Speaker 1: It's a place we all start from and a place

345
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,631
Speaker 1: some of us, hopefully, will graduate from

346
00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:08,266
Speaker 1: at some point in our evolutionary ascent,

347
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:12,968
Speaker 1: but some people never do so.

348
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:19,473
Speaker 1: Egocentric, the next stage of the

349
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:21,960
Speaker 1: self-development is called ethnocentric.

350
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:26,022
Speaker 1: And at the ethnocentric level we identify

351
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:30,121
Speaker 1: very much with our bloodline, with our

352
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:31,224
Speaker 1: family and our tribe.

353
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:33,090
Speaker 1: It's tribal consciousness.

354
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,807
Speaker 1: That's where our self sense is very

355
00:19:38,168 --> 00:19:42,927
Speaker 1: intensely identified with our clan, with

356
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:46,065
Speaker 1: our tribe, with our family, that kind of

357
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:46,828
Speaker 1: blood belonging.

358
00:19:51,040 --> 00:20:05,385
Speaker 1: And next level is world-centric, which is a

359
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:06,750
Speaker 1: very high level of consciousness

360
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,581
Speaker 1: development which is considered to be the

361
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:11,103
Speaker 1: leading edge in the world today, which is

362
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:19,102
Speaker 1: the identification, the universal nature of

363
00:20:19,142 --> 00:20:19,986
Speaker 1: being a human being.

364
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:23,865
Speaker 1: I see myself first and foremost as a human

365
00:20:23,905 --> 00:20:27,253
Speaker 1: being, as a member of the human family.

366
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:36,915
Speaker 1: So an individual at a world-centric,

367
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:39,299
Speaker 1: universal human level of development will

368
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,985
Speaker 1: see all human beings as his brothers and

369
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:42,546
Speaker 1: his sisters.

370
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,033
Speaker 1: And the highest level, the one level beyond

371
00:20:46,073 --> 00:20:49,768
Speaker 1: that which is the goal that all spiritual

372
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:53,653
Speaker 1: seekers after enlightenment yearn for and

373
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:56,207
Speaker 1: work towards, is called cosmocentric.

374
00:20:57,662 --> 00:20:59,420
Speaker 1: The cosmocentric level is when we identify

375
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:03,301
Speaker 1: with the evolutionary process itself as a

376
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:04,346
Speaker 1: source of our self-sense.

377
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:07,208
Speaker 1: I am the energy and intelligence that

378
00:21:07,228 --> 00:21:09,358
Speaker 1: created the universe, bearing witness to

379
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:10,882
Speaker 1: itself and awakening to itself through the

380
00:21:10,922 --> 00:21:14,630
Speaker 1: body-mind personality of Andrew or any one

381
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:14,911
Speaker 1: of you.

382
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:19,169
Speaker 1: So we have these basic, simple distinctions

383
00:21:19,229 --> 00:21:19,370
Speaker 1: here.

384
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:22,067
Speaker 1: There are more distinctions, but I'm trying

385
00:21:22,087 --> 00:21:23,811
Speaker 1: to keep it very simple for the point I want

386
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,626
Speaker 1: to make in this talk.

387
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,465
Speaker 1: So we have egocentric, ethnocentric

388
00:21:31,646 --> 00:21:33,909
Speaker 1: identifying with the clan and the bloodline,

389
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:40,296
Speaker 1: world-centric, universal, human and

390
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:42,799
Speaker 1: cosmocentric identification with the

391
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:44,682
Speaker 1: evolutionary principle itself and

392
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:48,394
Speaker 1: cosmocentric identification with the

393
00:21:48,414 --> 00:21:49,598
Speaker 1: evolutionary principle itself.

394
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,504
Speaker 1: Now, the fundamental point I want to make

395
00:21:53,585 --> 00:21:55,106
Speaker 1: is that what I'm calling the soul here,

396
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:57,610
Speaker 1: what I'm keep on referring to as the soul,

397
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,353
Speaker 1: this very, this deepest part of the self

398
00:22:00,373 --> 00:22:01,775
Speaker 1: that's still personal, where we have these

399
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:07,181
Speaker 1: very powerful and profound emotions that

400
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,725
Speaker 1: carry with them a great sense of importance

401
00:22:10,126 --> 00:22:12,970
Speaker 1: and gravitas and significance.

402
00:22:13,872 --> 00:22:18,403
Speaker 1: What, what you will feel in your soul as

403
00:22:18,443 --> 00:22:19,865
Speaker 1: being that of the greatest importance,

404
00:22:21,147 --> 00:22:24,633
Speaker 1: depends upon which state of consciousness

405
00:22:25,334 --> 00:22:26,295
Speaker 1: you are resting in.

406
00:22:29,922 --> 00:22:35,491
Speaker 1: So if you are, if you're at an ethnocentric

407
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:38,904
Speaker 1: stage of development where your primary

408
00:22:38,944 --> 00:22:40,670
Speaker 1: identification is with your family or your

409
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:48,320
Speaker 1: tribe or your blood group, your clan, the

410
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,004
Speaker 1: deepest feelings that you will experience

411
00:22:50,024 --> 00:22:52,629
Speaker 1: in your soul, your soul, felt emotions, the

412
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:54,754
Speaker 1: strongest emotions, positive and negative

413
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,066
Speaker 1: place where you experience the most

414
00:22:57,086 --> 00:23:04,430
Speaker 1: gravitas emotionally, will stem from your

415
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,434
Speaker 1: will, stem from that level of development.

416
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,408
Speaker 1: So your strongest feelings and your soul

417
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,281
Speaker 1: will relate to your identification with

418
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:13,102
Speaker 1: being part of a particular tribe or a

419
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:17,626
Speaker 1: particular family and your strongest

420
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,901
Speaker 1: emotions are going to be very related to

421
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:20,966
Speaker 1: that stage of development.

422
00:23:23,481 --> 00:23:24,866
Speaker 1: And we know, when people start to feel

423
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:27,301
Speaker 1: strong feelings in their soul, they're

424
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:30,268
Speaker 1: capable of great heroism in one hand and

425
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,013
Speaker 1: great evil on the other.

426
00:23:35,203 --> 00:23:37,370
Speaker 1: Because when we feel strong emotions in our

427
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,645
Speaker 1: soul, because it's coming from our soul, we

428
00:23:40,745 --> 00:23:45,084
Speaker 1: tend to never doubt the inherent value and

429
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,211
Speaker 1: what we imagine is an inherent truthfulness

430
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,066
Speaker 1: of what we're experiencing, because the

431
00:23:50,106 --> 00:23:53,662
Speaker 1: feelings are so strong at that level, we

432
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:55,207
Speaker 1: feel these feelings so strongly at that

433
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:56,351
Speaker 1: level that we feel this is truth.

434
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:02,645
Speaker 1: That's why we that's why when we meet

435
00:24:02,665 --> 00:24:04,050
Speaker 1: somebody that we consider to be our soul

436
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:10,904
Speaker 1: mate, it's so powerful.

437
00:24:10,924 --> 00:24:11,486
Speaker 1: I have no doubt.

438
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:12,648
Speaker 1: I've been waiting for you for a hundred

439
00:24:12,688 --> 00:24:13,169
Speaker 1: lifetimes.

440
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:17,504
Speaker 1: Maybe it's true, maybe it's not true, but

441
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:19,907
Speaker 1: because we feel it so intensely in our soul,

442
00:24:20,448 --> 00:24:21,630
Speaker 1: we have no doubt that it's true.

443
00:24:24,414 --> 00:24:27,541
Speaker 1: So egocentric, ethnocentric, so it's the

444
00:24:27,581 --> 00:24:29,726
Speaker 1: same thing with world-centric, universal

445
00:24:29,746 --> 00:24:32,453
Speaker 1: human values and feelings.

446
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:45,404
Speaker 1: A lot of people, for very noble reasons,

447
00:24:45,504 --> 00:24:52,535
Speaker 1: feel at the level of their soul how

448
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:53,961
Speaker 1: important it is that there's human rights

449
00:24:54,001 --> 00:25:02,447
Speaker 1: and fairness and justice in this world and

450
00:25:10,273 --> 00:25:14,036
Speaker 1: the flourishing of liberal democracies and

451
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:15,857
Speaker 1: the freedom for women and oppressed peoples

452
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:16,257
Speaker 1: everywhere.

453
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:19,464
Speaker 1: It comes to the end of racism and sexism

454
00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:27,334
Speaker 1: and patriarchy and so many things, because

455
00:25:27,354 --> 00:25:30,309
Speaker 1: we recognize that all human beings are part

456
00:25:30,349 --> 00:25:31,133
Speaker 1: of one species.

457
00:25:31,174 --> 00:25:32,401
Speaker 1: We're all brothers and sisters and

458
00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:38,330
Speaker 1: therefore we need to make this world a fair

459
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:38,711
Speaker 1: place.

460
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,750
Speaker 1: But some people feel that in their soul

461
00:25:45,161 --> 00:25:48,691
Speaker 1: this is a soul-felt conviction.

462
00:25:50,483 --> 00:25:51,959
Speaker 1: It's not something that is just believed

463
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:55,443
Speaker 1: and understood with the mind, it's a

464
00:25:55,483 --> 00:25:58,552
Speaker 1: soul-felt conviction.

465
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,525
Speaker 1: And when you feel something like that so

466
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:05,609
Speaker 1: strongly in your soul, it's something you

467
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,144
Speaker 1: might be willing to die for and fight for.

468
00:26:07,164 --> 00:26:09,510
Speaker 1: It's not a judgment.

469
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,730
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to make a point and then

470
00:26:19,147 --> 00:26:20,349
Speaker 1: and then we go from world-centric to

471
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:28,580
Speaker 1: cosmocentric, centric to Cosmo centric.

472
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:32,924
Speaker 1: So when you which is a very rare level of

473
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:33,917
Speaker 1: attainment I am the energy and intelligence

474
00:26:33,863 --> 00:26:34,673
Speaker 1: that created the universe, bearing with

475
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,175
Speaker 1: it's, bearing witness to itself through the

476
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:39,444
Speaker 1: body, mind, body, mind and personality of

477
00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:43,843
Speaker 1: each and every one of us, that's when, when

478
00:26:44,164 --> 00:26:47,663
Speaker 1: we relate to and identify with the

479
00:26:47,683 --> 00:26:53,581
Speaker 1: evolutionary process from our souls, that's

480
00:26:53,601 --> 00:27:00,288
Speaker 1: when it becomes a, there's a realness about

481
00:27:00,308 --> 00:27:03,082
Speaker 1: that stage of development that becomes

482
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:05,068
Speaker 1: different because we feel it in our souls.

483
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,368
Speaker 1: So one of the points I wanted to make was

484
00:27:17,408 --> 00:27:26,967
Speaker 1: that many of us relate to our experience,

485
00:27:27,007 --> 00:27:27,749
Speaker 1: to our intellects.

486
00:27:31,331 --> 00:27:32,880
Speaker 1: We're capable of so much understanding.

487
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,611
Speaker 1: We understand egocentrism and narcissism.

488
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:42,009
Speaker 1: We understand ethnocentric, tribal

489
00:27:46,137 --> 00:27:48,806
Speaker 1: perspectives and feelings, at least to a

490
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:55,509
Speaker 1: point, we recognize feelings of

491
00:27:55,589 --> 00:27:57,705
Speaker 1: universality, the universal nature of being

492
00:27:57,745 --> 00:28:05,127
Speaker 1: human, which is a world-centric perspective,

493
00:28:05,147 --> 00:28:11,943
Speaker 1: and world-centric feelings, and then

494
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:12,807
Speaker 1: there's cosmocentric.

495
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:16,586
Speaker 1: So what I'm saying is we can understand

496
00:28:16,606 --> 00:28:18,632
Speaker 1: these distinctions with our intellects.

497
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:22,225
Speaker 1: We can appreciate them intellectually,

498
00:28:23,047 --> 00:28:24,931
Speaker 1: metaphorically, at a level of abstraction.

499
00:28:24,951 --> 00:28:27,116
Speaker 1: We can appreciate them intellectually,

500
00:28:27,216 --> 00:28:28,700
Speaker 1: metaphorically, at a level of abstraction.

501
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,841
Speaker 1: And then there's the level of actual

502
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:32,822
Speaker 1: feeling, of deep, soul-level feeling, and

503
00:28:32,882 --> 00:28:34,644
Speaker 1: one of the points I wanted to make was that

504
00:28:37,126 --> 00:28:38,808
Speaker 1: when we experience these distinctions at a

505
00:28:38,848 --> 00:28:42,891
Speaker 1: soul level, we're not just understanding

506
00:28:42,932 --> 00:28:46,515
Speaker 1: these distinctions at a level of mind and

507
00:28:47,216 --> 00:28:53,450
Speaker 1: mental or intellectual abstraction, but

508
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,458
Speaker 1: we're understanding them with our gut, with

509
00:28:54,478 --> 00:28:59,494
Speaker 1: our soul, the deepest nature of ourself.

510
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:02,925
Speaker 1: And because, basically, what I'm speaking

511
00:29:02,945 --> 00:29:03,691
Speaker 1: about has to do with what is it that we

512
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:04,224
Speaker 1: care about the most?

513
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:04,795
Speaker 1: What is it that you care about the most?

514
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:04,822
Speaker 1: With?

515
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,413
Speaker 1: What is it that we care about the most.

516
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:06,657
Speaker 1: What is it that you care about the most?

517
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,026
Speaker 1: What is it that I care about the most?

518
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,788
Speaker 1: Because what we care about the most will be

519
00:29:16,828 --> 00:29:20,083
Speaker 1: reflected in our soul level, in this

520
00:29:20,123 --> 00:29:21,468
Speaker 1: experience we're having at the level of our

521
00:29:21,508 --> 00:29:21,909
Speaker 1: souls.

522
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:26,068
Speaker 1: So what do you really care about the most?

523
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,702
Speaker 1: What you care about the most is what you

524
00:29:28,722 --> 00:29:45,262
Speaker 1: feel in your soul, and a big part of the

525
00:29:45,282 --> 00:29:46,764
Speaker 1: higher and more profound levels of

526
00:29:47,324 --> 00:29:50,428
Speaker 1: spiritual transformation has to do with, I

527
00:29:50,448 --> 00:29:53,572
Speaker 1: believe, the evolution of our capacity to

528
00:29:53,632 --> 00:29:57,136
Speaker 1: care about higher matters at the level of

529
00:29:57,236 --> 00:29:57,816
Speaker 1: our souls.

530
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,402
Speaker 1: So, to repeat, I believe that a very

531
00:30:08,423 --> 00:30:09,305
Speaker 1: significant part of what higher spiritual

532
00:30:09,325 --> 00:30:10,208
Speaker 1: development is about is learning how to

533
00:30:10,228 --> 00:30:12,215
Speaker 1: care, learning what it means to deeply care,

534
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:14,663
Speaker 1: in this case about the evolution of

535
00:30:14,703 --> 00:30:18,897
Speaker 1: consciousness, not from your mind, not

536
00:30:18,937 --> 00:30:21,984
Speaker 1: appreciating that this would be a very good

537
00:30:22,064 --> 00:30:24,970
Speaker 1: idea and makes reasonable sense, but that

538
00:30:25,431 --> 00:30:30,401
Speaker 1: you begin to care because your soul has

539
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:33,975
Speaker 1: awakened to that level of consciousness, to

540
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:35,160
Speaker 1: its significance, and then you begin to

541
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,965
Speaker 1: care, beyond what your mind may think from

542
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:41,993
Speaker 1: time to time, about the evolution of

543
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:44,123
Speaker 1: consciousness for its own sake, because

544
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:46,390
Speaker 1: your soul has awakened to that level of

545
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,032
Speaker 1: development.

546
00:30:48,862 --> 00:30:50,307
Speaker 1: So the soul has to do with what you care

547
00:30:50,347 --> 00:30:50,989
Speaker 1: about the most.

548
00:30:56,546 --> 00:30:59,976
Speaker 1: Where are you rooted in your deepest

549
00:31:00,979 --> 00:31:09,178
Speaker 1: preferences, preferences now, when we look

550
00:31:09,198 --> 00:31:10,562
Speaker 1: at that question superficially, we find

551
00:31:10,582 --> 00:31:12,570
Speaker 1: that for most people it's egoic,

552
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,443
Speaker 1: self-concern, survival at lower levels and

553
00:31:17,553 --> 00:31:18,220
Speaker 1: beyond survival.

554
00:31:18,321 --> 00:31:21,664
Speaker 1: It has to do with egocentric, unfortunately

555
00:31:21,885 --> 00:31:24,955
Speaker 1: often materialistic survival, materialistic

556
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:27,063
Speaker 1: survival, materialistic self concern and

557
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:29,187
Speaker 1: narcissistic self concern.

558
00:31:31,913 --> 00:31:41,221
Speaker 1: Not an awakened souls, feeling of

559
00:31:41,282 --> 00:31:44,350
Speaker 1: overwhelming value about the nature and the

560
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,483
Speaker 1: nature and inherent meaning of

561
00:31:45,524 --> 00:31:49,847
Speaker 1: self-existence, the significance of

562
00:31:50,168 --> 00:31:53,323
Speaker 1: consciousness and the significance of the

563
00:31:53,384 --> 00:31:55,731
Speaker 1: evolution of the cosmos.

564
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:00,329
Speaker 1: What are you living for?

565
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:07,923
Speaker 1: Because we can't really live for spirit and

566
00:32:07,943 --> 00:32:11,101
Speaker 1: for these higher spiritual values unless we

567
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:12,767
Speaker 1: have awakened, at the level of the soul,

568
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,645
Speaker 1: these higher principles.

569
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,068
Speaker 1: So the question I'm asking is where is any

570
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:26,892
Speaker 1: one of us at the level of our soul?

571
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:49,179
Speaker 1: So often we find that for many people our

572
00:32:49,219 --> 00:33:00,046
Speaker 1: soul is very much related to materialistic

573
00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:02,408
Speaker 1: concerns and narcissistic concerns,

574
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,056
Speaker 1: heaven-centric concerns.

575
00:33:12,953 --> 00:33:14,524
Speaker 1: But when your soul is related to these

576
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,757
Speaker 1: deeper dimensions of the self and deeper

577
00:33:17,777 --> 00:33:20,532
Speaker 1: dimensions of reality, this is when

578
00:33:22,476 --> 00:33:24,440
Speaker 1: spiritual evolution begins to happen for

579
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:24,721
Speaker 1: real.

580
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,837
Speaker 1: It's when you become a truly transformed,

581
00:33:30,521 --> 00:33:31,203
Speaker 1: sentient being.

582
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,230
Speaker 1: That's when the soul begins to get, when

583
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:45,679
Speaker 1: the soul literally begins to identify

584
00:33:45,699 --> 00:33:54,034
Speaker 1: itself with unqualified spirit and

585
00:33:54,054 --> 00:33:56,919
Speaker 1: something really changes in each and every

586
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:59,424
Speaker 1: one of us at the deepest level.

587
00:33:59,891 --> 00:34:03,276
Speaker 1: It's when your soul gets so drenched in the

588
00:34:03,316 --> 00:34:05,339
Speaker 1: consciousness of eternity, for example,

589
00:34:07,202 --> 00:34:08,925
Speaker 1: that it's something you can't forget, you

590
00:34:08,945 --> 00:34:09,611
Speaker 1: can't turn away from.

591
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:12,036
Speaker 1: You've been so deeply touched that your

592
00:34:12,076 --> 00:34:15,984
Speaker 1: soul is now awakened to eternity and it's

593
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,177
Speaker 1: something that your soul knows about.

594
00:34:17,257 --> 00:34:18,746
Speaker 1: Now, your soul knows about eternity.

595
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:20,072
Speaker 1: It's not that your ego had a great

596
00:34:20,112 --> 00:34:21,255
Speaker 1: experience that it remembers, but it's

597
00:34:21,275 --> 00:34:21,756
Speaker 1: something about eternity.

598
00:34:21,776 --> 00:34:22,458
Speaker 1: It's not that your ego had a great

599
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:23,261
Speaker 1: experience that it remembers, but it's

600
00:34:23,281 --> 00:34:24,605
Speaker 1: something that you know, it's something

601
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:26,691
Speaker 1: that your soul knows and your soul, the

602
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:27,575
Speaker 1: soul, never forgets.

603
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,753
Speaker 1: The soul is the most important part of each

604
00:34:52,773 --> 00:34:53,234
Speaker 1: and every one of us.

605
00:34:53,254 --> 00:34:57,023
Speaker 1: The soul is the source of our integrity, or

606
00:34:57,063 --> 00:34:58,005
Speaker 1: lack of integrity.

607
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:03,298
Speaker 1: The soul is where we find our capacity for

608
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:05,143
Speaker 1: wholeness and integration.

609
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,720
Speaker 1: Deep kindness, unselfish deep kindness,

610
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:25,263
Speaker 1: love, loyalty, care, selflessness or not.

611
00:35:31,772 --> 00:35:33,294
Speaker 1: I believe it's the soul, it's that

612
00:35:33,335 --> 00:35:34,813
Speaker 1: dimension of ourselves where we have that

613
00:35:34,953 --> 00:35:35,797
Speaker 1: rude awakening.

614
00:35:38,172 --> 00:35:42,136
Speaker 1: Rude awakening is when you get a glimpse of

615
00:35:42,156 --> 00:35:44,715
Speaker 1: the totality of reality, whatever way it

616
00:35:44,755 --> 00:35:47,128
Speaker 1: happens, and you glimpse, for maybe an

617
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:50,663
Speaker 1: instant, where you're really at in

618
00:35:50,683 --> 00:35:52,049
Speaker 1: relationship to the experience of being

619
00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:52,230
Speaker 1: human.

620
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:56,121
Speaker 1: For a moment, you glimpse your true motives

621
00:35:59,213 --> 00:36:00,338
Speaker 1: and it may be a rude awakening.

622
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,839
Speaker 1: You might find out that you're not as true,

623
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:07,497
Speaker 1: authentic and pure well-meaning, as you may

624
00:36:07,557 --> 00:36:10,296
Speaker 1: imagine yourself to be, or you may find

625
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:15,442
Speaker 1: that you are, that the place you find it,

626
00:36:15,502 --> 00:36:17,770
Speaker 1: the place within yourself that you find out

627
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,712
Speaker 1: the answers to these kinds of questions is

628
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:20,292
Speaker 1: in your soul.

629
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,632
Speaker 1: So, for example, when you can hear some

630
00:36:44,652 --> 00:36:45,375
Speaker 1: people speak about their spiritual

631
00:36:45,395 --> 00:36:46,317
Speaker 1: experiences, some people will speak, maybe

632
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,524
Speaker 1: in a very articulate and intellectually

633
00:36:48,544 --> 00:36:51,231
Speaker 1: coherent way, about higher states and

634
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,915
Speaker 1: higher state experiences that they may have

635
00:36:52,955 --> 00:36:53,236
Speaker 1: had.

636
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,775
Speaker 1: But have they been touched at the level of

637
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:00,143
Speaker 1: the soul by those experiences or has it

638
00:37:00,163 --> 00:37:07,920
Speaker 1: really been an interesting process that

639
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,462
Speaker 1: they went through that still leaves them

640
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:10,765
Speaker 1: fundamentally unchanged?

641
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:17,094
Speaker 1: When we're touched at the level of our soul,

642
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:20,417
Speaker 1: it's impossible for us to remain unchanged.

643
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:30,166
Speaker 1: And the longer that I live and the longer

644
00:37:30,186 --> 00:37:32,027
Speaker 1: that I teach and the more experience I have,

645
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,493
Speaker 1: I think that the development of the soul,

646
00:37:38,514 --> 00:37:39,877
Speaker 1: the conscious development of the soul, the

647
00:37:39,897 --> 00:37:40,859
Speaker 1: conscious cultivation of the soul, might be

648
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:42,362
Speaker 1: the most important part of spiritual

649
00:37:42,402 --> 00:37:45,217
Speaker 1: practice and being involved in the

650
00:37:45,237 --> 00:37:46,100
Speaker 1: spiritual process.

651
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:50,117
Speaker 1: Because, as to repeat what I said a few

652
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:52,076
Speaker 1: minutes ago, because the soul is the place

653
00:37:52,096 --> 00:37:59,082
Speaker 1: where we find our capacity, or lack of

654
00:37:59,242 --> 00:38:17,872
Speaker 1: capacity, for authenticity, deep

655
00:38:17,892 --> 00:38:18,454
Speaker 1: trustworthiness, gravitas and

656
00:38:18,474 --> 00:38:21,566
Speaker 1: single-pointedness in relationship to

657
00:38:21,586 --> 00:38:22,329
Speaker 1: consciousness development and soul

658
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:22,570
Speaker 1: development.

659
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,713
Speaker 1: Now, in Western postmodern culture, the

660
00:38:24,734 --> 00:38:26,256
Speaker 1: soul is not something we speak about that

661
00:38:26,396 --> 00:38:33,274
Speaker 1: often, and often when I hear people speak

662
00:38:33,294 --> 00:38:34,998
Speaker 1: about the soul in spiritual contexts,

663
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:38,056
Speaker 1: generally to make a gross generalization it

664
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:40,085
Speaker 1: often seems to have more to do with the

665
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:44,059
Speaker 1: ego's deeper feelings than anything else.

666
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,493
Speaker 1: The soul is that part of ourself in which

667
00:38:53,513 --> 00:39:03,732
Speaker 1: we glimpse what a deadly serious matter the

668
00:39:03,752 --> 00:39:06,617
Speaker 1: gift of life is, the gift of conscious life,

669
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:12,347
Speaker 1: the gift of life that is consciously

670
00:39:12,387 --> 00:39:13,573
Speaker 1: experienced in the context of

671
00:39:13,613 --> 00:39:14,778
Speaker 1: self-reflective awareness.

672
00:39:16,997 --> 00:39:22,901
Speaker 1: The soul is the place where we realize this

673
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:23,603
Speaker 1: is not a game.

674
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,074
Speaker 1: We're not going to get any second chances

675
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:29,972
Speaker 1: necessarily, that everything counts.

676
00:39:30,013 --> 00:39:33,701
Speaker 1: The karma is real, there's no way out,

677
00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:34,563
Speaker 1: there's no escape.

678
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:37,818
Speaker 1: There's no way out, there's no escape.

679
00:39:38,872 --> 00:39:42,461
Speaker 1: And it's where we awaken to this shocking

680
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:45,074
Speaker 1: recognition that this is it, when, always,

681
00:39:45,114 --> 00:39:46,638
Speaker 1: now, in the present moment, that this is

682
00:39:46,738 --> 00:39:50,972
Speaker 1: really it, that this really counts, that

683
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:52,514
Speaker 1: all the important choices we make really

684
00:39:52,554 --> 00:39:57,961
Speaker 1: count, and there's no extricating ourselves

685
00:39:58,001 --> 00:40:01,685
Speaker 1: from a karmic momentum.

686
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,495
Speaker 1: We're all part and parcel of a very complex

687
00:40:06,616 --> 00:40:07,960
Speaker 1: process of karmic momentum.

688
00:40:10,972 --> 00:40:14,151
Speaker 1: We can't disentangle ourselves from it, but

689
00:40:14,191 --> 00:40:16,197
Speaker 1: we can, through spiritual practice,

690
00:40:19,568 --> 00:40:24,378
Speaker 1: cultivate the capacity to consciously add

691
00:40:26,102 --> 00:40:27,532
Speaker 1: that which is most positive to the

692
00:40:27,552 --> 00:40:34,783
Speaker 1: complexity of the karmic process that we

693
00:40:34,843 --> 00:40:38,838
Speaker 1: are entangled in, we can, through our own

694
00:40:39,555 --> 00:40:45,200
Speaker 1: focused intention, bring some genuine

695
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,403
Speaker 1: positivity to the process.

696
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:51,298
Speaker 1: That's real, that will affect the process

697
00:40:51,338 --> 00:40:56,885
Speaker 1: as a whole in its own way, because a lot of

698
00:40:56,925 --> 00:40:58,290
Speaker 1: us like to think of ourselves as somehow

699
00:40:59,131 --> 00:41:01,154
Speaker 1: not responsible and somehow that we're

700
00:41:01,354 --> 00:41:03,958
Speaker 1: standing outside this vast cosmic process

701
00:41:03,998 --> 00:41:07,904
Speaker 1: watching as kind of observers, observers

702
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,894
Speaker 1: and victims, not co-creators.

703
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:14,705
Speaker 1: But when we wake up, in the way that I've

704
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:16,552
Speaker 1: been describing, we realize we're always

705
00:41:16,572 --> 00:41:18,258
Speaker 1: co-creators, whether we're conscious of it

706
00:41:18,338 --> 00:41:18,759
Speaker 1: or not.

707
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,115
Speaker 1: We're always co-creators, whether we're

708
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,423
Speaker 1: conscious of it or not.

709
00:41:22,348 --> 00:41:23,079
Speaker 1: We're always called creators, whether we're

710
00:41:23,004 --> 00:41:23,845
Speaker 1: conscious of it or not.

711
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:26,246
Speaker 1: And when you really begin to wake up, you

712
00:41:26,266 --> 00:41:27,567
Speaker 1: realize, number one, that that's true,

713
00:41:27,587 --> 00:41:30,155
Speaker 1: there's no time off or days off, the time

714
00:41:30,315 --> 00:41:33,703
Speaker 1: out and everything counts, and that the

715
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:37,736
Speaker 1: state of consciousness, in the state of

716
00:41:38,237 --> 00:41:41,482
Speaker 1: development of our souls, is all important,

717
00:41:41,562 --> 00:41:45,242
Speaker 1: because that will indicate the ways in

718
00:41:45,262 --> 00:41:46,370
Speaker 1: which we're going to be able to contribute

719
00:41:47,795 --> 00:41:51,279
Speaker 1: positively or not to this cosmic unfolding

720
00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:55,893
Speaker 1: that we're part and parcel of always.

721
00:42:07,206 --> 00:42:08,727
Speaker 1: So in this context, we can think about the

722
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,930
Speaker 1: processes in terms of spiritual practice

723
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,873
Speaker 1: and purification, the cultivation of

724
00:42:14,194 --> 00:42:17,277
Speaker 1: purification and integration of higher

725
00:42:17,317 --> 00:42:20,401
Speaker 1: wholeness and of a higher motivation,

726
00:42:22,003 --> 00:42:23,464
Speaker 1: ultimately, not for our own sake, not for

727
00:42:23,524 --> 00:42:29,539
Speaker 1: our own liberation, not for our own soul

728
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:31,514
Speaker 1: salvation, but so that we'll be able to

729
00:42:31,534 --> 00:42:34,906
Speaker 1: contribute that which is unimaginably

730
00:42:34,966 --> 00:42:38,758
Speaker 1: wholesome and purely positive to this

731
00:42:38,898 --> 00:42:44,581
Speaker 1: unconscious hurricane that is the

732
00:42:44,622 --> 00:42:46,251
Speaker 1: complexity of this cosmic process that

733
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:46,995
Speaker 1: we're in the midst of.

734
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:50,716
Speaker 1: There's so much positivity that we can

735
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:53,034
Speaker 1: bring to this If we're willing to make the

736
00:42:53,054 --> 00:42:55,199
Speaker 1: effort to do so and to sacrifice ourselves,

737
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,053
Speaker 1: to sacrifice our egos, because the ego

738
00:42:59,073 --> 00:43:00,118
Speaker 1: always has another agenda.

739
00:43:00,971 --> 00:43:02,435
Speaker 1: I want to do this and I want to do that

740
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:05,282
Speaker 1: because it's all for me.

741
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,518
Speaker 1: I want to do this and I want to do that.

742
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,972
Speaker 1: The ego has an ego almost always has

743
00:43:12,012 --> 00:43:30,404
Speaker 1: another agenda in mind, and when we begin

744
00:43:30,424 --> 00:43:32,805
Speaker 1: to see ourselves, and when we can see

745
00:43:32,845 --> 00:43:37,351
Speaker 1: ourselves and locate ourselves in the midst

746
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:42,119
Speaker 1: of this chaos and confusion, we begin to

747
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:45,424
Speaker 1: recognize how important our contribution,

748
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:52,931
Speaker 1: how as much positivity as possible is, not

749
00:43:52,971 --> 00:43:54,551
Speaker 1: as a secondary contribution but as a

750
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:56,452
Speaker 1: fundamental contribution, as our essential

751
00:43:56,513 --> 00:44:00,672
Speaker 1: gift to the universe, if we have enough

752
00:44:00,712 --> 00:44:03,380
Speaker 1: courage to do it.

753
00:44:15,993 --> 00:44:18,436
Speaker 1: So is your soul fundamentally identified

754
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:25,593
Speaker 1: with your ego and its fears and desires and

755
00:44:27,006 --> 00:44:33,941
Speaker 1: grievances and frustrations and unresolved

756
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:34,301
Speaker 1: trauma?

757
00:44:37,033 --> 00:44:40,960
Speaker 1: Is that what your soul is identified with?

758
00:44:44,772 --> 00:44:48,201
Speaker 1: Is your soul identified with your bloodline,

759
00:44:54,032 --> 00:45:01,315
Speaker 1: your biological identity and a profound

760
00:45:01,355 --> 00:45:04,973
Speaker 1: sense of self-importance in the positive

761
00:45:05,013 --> 00:45:06,559
Speaker 1: sense that that brings with it.

762
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,716
Speaker 1: Just think for a minute where is your soul

763
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:17,359
Speaker 1: identified?

764
00:45:27,608 --> 00:45:27,968
Speaker 1: Identified?

765
00:45:31,382 --> 00:45:32,649
Speaker 1: If you're interested in enlightenment in a

766
00:45:32,669 --> 00:45:38,564
Speaker 1: serious way, then that would mean that your

767
00:45:38,584 --> 00:45:41,590
Speaker 1: soul is identified with eternity, and which

768
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:50,808
Speaker 1: is birthless and deathless, timeless and

769
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:51,590
Speaker 1: formless and beginningless and endless.

770
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,912
Speaker 1: Or is your soul identified with the

771
00:45:53,952 --> 00:46:02,578
Speaker 1: evolutionary impulse God forces, the force

772
00:46:02,658 --> 00:46:05,740
Speaker 1: of creativity as the universe in the

773
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:18,212
Speaker 1: universe and in this process?

774
00:46:18,252 --> 00:46:20,255
Speaker 1: It's very important and very helpful to

775
00:46:20,295 --> 00:46:22,799
Speaker 1: learn how to do to the practice of

776
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:27,812
Speaker 1: contemplative inquiry, contemplative

777
00:46:27,852 --> 00:46:28,594
Speaker 1: self-scrutiny.

778
00:46:28,634 --> 00:46:33,014
Speaker 1: Contemplative inquiry For you and I do this

779
00:46:33,074 --> 00:46:39,752
Speaker 1: myself as often as possible, like every day

780
00:46:41,155 --> 00:46:43,802
Speaker 1: is to learn how to practice to discriminate

781
00:46:43,822 --> 00:46:50,058
Speaker 1: between the concerns of your ego and the

782
00:46:50,078 --> 00:46:58,654
Speaker 1: concerns of your soul, because the ego can

783
00:46:58,674 --> 00:47:01,064
Speaker 1: have very strong feelings, very strong

784
00:47:01,104 --> 00:47:02,730
Speaker 1: likes and dislikes and all kinds of

785
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:07,596
Speaker 1: preferences, and they can be very

786
00:47:07,656 --> 00:47:08,838
Speaker 1: distracting, we all know.

787
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:20,379
Speaker 1: But your soul feels things even more deeply

788
00:47:20,419 --> 00:47:21,922
Speaker 1: than your ego does, as powerful as your

789
00:47:21,962 --> 00:47:22,964
Speaker 1: egoic feelings can be.

790
00:47:26,992 --> 00:47:28,538
Speaker 1: And are you aware, as you're going through

791
00:47:28,558 --> 00:47:30,814
Speaker 1: the ups and downs, of how the ego might

792
00:47:30,834 --> 00:47:32,961
Speaker 1: feel and how the soul might feel?

793
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:34,296
Speaker 1: Are you aware of the difference between the

794
00:47:34,336 --> 00:47:34,436
Speaker 1: two?

795
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:55,623
Speaker 1: Because the soul is always very concerned

796
00:47:55,643 --> 00:47:57,724
Speaker 1: with what you know and what feels most

797
00:47:57,744 --> 00:47:58,184
Speaker 1: important.

798
00:48:09,989 --> 00:48:11,471
Speaker 1: It's very important to understand that what

799
00:48:11,532 --> 00:48:14,852
Speaker 1: I'm calling the true self, the grounded

800
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:19,675
Speaker 1: being, doesn't have preferences.

801
00:48:22,571 --> 00:48:28,319
Speaker 1: It's free from all events or anything and

802
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:29,221
Speaker 1: everything that ever happens.

803
00:48:31,172 --> 00:48:32,992
Speaker 1: The true self is free from and not

804
00:48:33,032 --> 00:48:34,097
Speaker 1: identified with any of it.

805
00:48:38,651 --> 00:48:40,711
Speaker 1: That's why it's the awakened soul that has

806
00:48:40,732 --> 00:48:44,574
Speaker 1: to be our guide, because the true self is

807
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,630
Speaker 1: pure, unqualified, absolute is-ness.

808
00:48:52,053 --> 00:48:53,434
Speaker 1: It doesn't make preferences, it doesn't

809
00:48:53,454 --> 00:48:55,656
Speaker 1: make choices because it's always already

810
00:48:55,676 --> 00:48:56,036
Speaker 1: free.

811
00:49:06,304 --> 00:49:07,845
Speaker 1: So a big part of spiritual practice is

812
00:49:07,925 --> 00:49:09,166
Speaker 1: learning how to distinguish between the

813
00:49:09,206 --> 00:49:13,731
Speaker 1: soul's feelings and preferences and the

814
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:15,153
Speaker 1: ego's feelings and preferences.

815
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:22,161
Speaker 1: People who are living life from their soul

816
00:49:22,822 --> 00:49:26,366
Speaker 1: are much deeper people, much deeper beings

817
00:49:28,612 --> 00:49:30,234
Speaker 1: they are.

818
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:34,958
Speaker 1: They have more weight as sentient beings

819
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:37,921
Speaker 1: because they, because they're much more

820
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:43,026
Speaker 1: connected to depth and value and meaning

821
00:49:43,067 --> 00:49:46,837
Speaker 1: and purpose and the significance of history

822
00:49:46,897 --> 00:49:52,756
Speaker 1: and karma and direction.

823
00:50:00,652 --> 00:50:01,776
Speaker 1: So we don't want to swim around on the

824
00:50:01,796 --> 00:50:11,780
Speaker 1: surface of life, lost in the egos, fears

825
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:15,585
Speaker 1: and desires, likes and dislikes, as so many

826
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:21,798
Speaker 1: people do these days, lost, so deeply lost,

827
00:50:21,878 --> 00:50:23,181
Speaker 1: and not even knowing that they're lost.

828
00:50:24,463 --> 00:50:26,334
Speaker 1: Is it worse to be lost or is it worse to be

829
00:50:26,354 --> 00:50:27,056
Speaker 1: lost and not know?

830
00:50:27,076 --> 00:50:28,460
Speaker 1: And I think it's worse to be lost and not

831
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:28,681
Speaker 1: know?

832
00:50:29,953 --> 00:50:31,317
Speaker 1: If you're lost and you know you're lost.

833
00:50:32,219 --> 00:50:34,812
Speaker 1: You're not completely lost, but if you're

834
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:36,197
Speaker 1: lost and you don't know you're lost, then

835
00:50:36,237 --> 00:50:36,999
Speaker 1: you're really lost.

836
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:52,871
Speaker 1: And if you think you're lost and it scares

837
00:50:52,891 --> 00:50:53,231
Speaker 1: you, that's good.

838
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:55,452
Speaker 1: Sometimes it's good to be scared of being

839
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:57,814
Speaker 1: lost because it'll help you to care about

840
00:50:57,834 --> 00:50:58,474
Speaker 1: deeper matters.

841
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:22,873
Speaker 1: So, as you meditate, as you practice in

842
00:51:22,893 --> 00:51:26,744
Speaker 1: self-inquiry, as you practice contemplation,

843
00:51:28,529 --> 00:51:31,435
Speaker 1: as you screw in your own internal thoughts

844
00:51:31,475 --> 00:51:33,800
Speaker 1: and feelings, highs and lows, ups and downs,

845
00:51:38,049 --> 00:51:39,173
Speaker 1: try to find out where you're at in

846
00:51:39,193 --> 00:51:40,277
Speaker 1: relationship to your soul.

847
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,057
Speaker 1: What is your soul that you care about?

848
00:51:45,711 --> 00:51:47,398
Speaker 1: What is your soul focused on?

849
00:51:48,391 --> 00:51:50,759
Speaker 1: Where are you at in relationship to your

850
00:51:50,799 --> 00:51:51,100
Speaker 1: soul?

851
00:51:57,791 --> 00:52:00,560
Speaker 1: Because it's my belief I can't prove this,

852
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:02,275
Speaker 1: but it's my belief that the soul, as I said,

853
00:52:02,335 --> 00:52:08,557
Speaker 1: is the metaphysical organ in which there's

854
00:52:08,597 --> 00:52:12,384
Speaker 1: continuity from life to life.

855
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:33,599
Speaker 1: I always ask people is there continuity in

856
00:52:33,619 --> 00:52:35,241
Speaker 1: the material process of the evolving cosmos?

857
00:52:35,281 --> 00:52:36,422
Speaker 1: Is there continuity in the evolution of the

858
00:52:36,482 --> 00:52:39,145
Speaker 1: energy and matter that make up the evolving

859
00:52:39,205 --> 00:52:39,506
Speaker 1: universe?

860
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:41,977
Speaker 1: Is there continuity from the Big Bang until

861
00:52:41,997 --> 00:52:42,217
Speaker 1: now?

862
00:52:44,093 --> 00:52:46,419
Speaker 1: Is there continuity in the past 14 billion

863
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:49,656
Speaker 1: years of evolutionary becoming at the level

864
00:52:49,696 --> 00:52:50,338
Speaker 1: of matter and energy?

865
00:52:50,611 --> 00:52:51,955
Speaker 1: And then we'll say, yes, there's continuity.

866
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:54,756
Speaker 1: So if there's continuity at the level of

867
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,494
Speaker 1: energy and matter for the last 14 billion

868
00:52:56,514 --> 00:53:00,296
Speaker 1: years at the level of matter and energy,

869
00:53:02,311 --> 00:53:03,817
Speaker 1: which is considered to be the outside of

870
00:53:03,837 --> 00:53:04,339
Speaker 1: the universe.

871
00:53:05,593 --> 00:53:09,837
Speaker 1: Why would there not also be continuity on

872
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:11,862
Speaker 1: the inside, at the level of interiority?

873
00:53:13,471 --> 00:53:15,476
Speaker 1: Because, as integral philosophies made us

874
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,635
Speaker 1: aware, the universe has an inside and an

875
00:53:19,736 --> 00:53:20,117
Speaker 1: outside.

876
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,773
Speaker 1: Matter and energy of the exterior

877
00:53:29,102 --> 00:53:32,376
Speaker 1: subjectivity, interiority are the inside.

878
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,710
Speaker 1: So if the exterior of the universe has

879
00:53:35,751 --> 00:53:37,577
Speaker 1: continuity, it makes sense that the

880
00:53:37,697 --> 00:53:40,599
Speaker 1: interior of the universe, which is

881
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,250
Speaker 1: interiority itself, is part of that

882
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:46,737
Speaker 1: continuity, that there is continuity in the

883
00:53:46,877 --> 00:53:50,664
Speaker 1: interior of the evolving universe, in the

884
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:52,033
Speaker 1: inside of the evolving universe.

885
00:53:55,690 --> 00:54:00,516
Speaker 1: What I've been referring to as the soul, I

886
00:54:00,536 --> 00:54:02,298
Speaker 1: believe, is part and parcel of the

887
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:03,800
Speaker 1: continuity of that interiority.

888
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:12,733
Speaker 1: So what I'm calling the soul has been

889
00:54:13,433 --> 00:54:18,897
Speaker 1: present in some partial form from the very

890
00:54:18,917 --> 00:54:32,727
Speaker 1: beginning, or, if not from the very

891
00:54:32,847 --> 00:54:46,179
Speaker 1: beginning, it's been part of this.

892
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:55,527
Speaker 1: That relates to the biggest vision of

893
00:54:55,567 --> 00:54:59,253
Speaker 1: becoming your biggest and my biggest

894
00:54:59,554 --> 00:55:03,281
Speaker 1: glimpse or vision or insight into the

895
00:55:03,321 --> 00:55:05,044
Speaker 1: nature of being part of a cosmic process.

896
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:08,278
Speaker 1: It's been a process for a very long time.

897
00:55:09,151 --> 00:55:10,455
Speaker 1: That's beginning to awaken to itself

898
00:55:10,495 --> 00:55:14,694
Speaker 1: through you, through me, but it's glimpsing

899
00:55:14,754 --> 00:55:21,322
Speaker 1: the significance of being part of this for

900
00:55:21,342 --> 00:55:24,796
Speaker 1: so long, of being inherently meshed in this

901
00:55:24,836 --> 00:55:25,739
Speaker 1: process for so long.

902
00:55:27,715 --> 00:55:29,453
Speaker 1: And when you awaken to that and you

903
00:55:29,473 --> 00:55:34,556
Speaker 1: recognize it, it's awe-inspiring and

904
00:55:34,616 --> 00:55:41,613
Speaker 1: overwhelming Because it means we've all

905
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:42,757
Speaker 1: been here for a very long time.

906
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,682
Speaker 1: We just haven't known it.

907
00:55:52,211 --> 00:55:53,496
Speaker 1: So as we wake up to how long we've been

908
00:55:53,516 --> 00:56:08,012
Speaker 1: here, then the self tries to, then the self

909
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:09,819
Speaker 1: tries to grapple with how can I possibly

910
00:56:09,859 --> 00:56:10,762
Speaker 1: take responsibility for all of this?

911
00:56:10,782 --> 00:56:11,966
Speaker 1: Who am I if I've been around for all this

912
00:56:11,986 --> 00:56:12,107
Speaker 1: time?

913
00:56:14,172 --> 00:56:14,574
Speaker 1: Little old me.

914
00:56:14,594 --> 00:56:23,951
Speaker 1: It's enormous, very challenging, daunting,

915
00:56:23,971 --> 00:56:33,188
Speaker 1: very challenging, daunting.

916
00:56:33,248 --> 00:56:35,616
Speaker 1: So how conscious are we to how big all this

917
00:56:35,696 --> 00:56:37,637
Speaker 1: is and how profound it all really is?

918
00:56:45,665 --> 00:56:46,287
Speaker 1: It all really is.

919
00:56:47,331 --> 00:56:48,400
Speaker 1: The more we can face and come to terms with

920
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,273
Speaker 1: the enormity of this process that we are

921
00:56:50,413 --> 00:56:53,732
Speaker 1: inherently a part and parcel of, the more

922
00:56:53,772 --> 00:56:55,170
Speaker 1: profound will be the life that we live and

923
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,251
Speaker 1: our reasons for living it.

924
00:57:31,727 --> 00:57:33,948
Speaker 1: Thank you, so your, your soul, or the soul,

925
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:40,061
Speaker 1: can see beyond the limitations of just this

926
00:57:40,842 --> 00:57:42,245
Speaker 1: small life you're living, right.

927
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:47,552
Speaker 1: I'm not saying your life is small, but the

928
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:49,093
Speaker 1: limited nature of how we think about what

929
00:57:49,153 --> 00:57:49,953
Speaker 1: it means to be alive.

930
00:57:49,973 --> 00:58:24,208
Speaker 1: So the reason why it's so important to

931
00:58:24,228 --> 00:58:25,928
Speaker 1: meditate every day is so that we will have

932
00:58:25,948 --> 00:58:29,657
Speaker 1: these glimpses, which are often hard.

933
00:58:29,697 --> 00:58:31,360
Speaker 1: When we get these glimpses, way beyond the

934
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:34,571
Speaker 1: narrow confines of our ego and its narrow

935
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:38,091
Speaker 1: relationship to personal history, when we

936
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:40,234
Speaker 1: get these glimpses, relationship to

937
00:58:40,254 --> 00:58:41,787
Speaker 1: personal history, when we get these

938
00:58:41,828 --> 00:58:45,118
Speaker 1: glimpses, it widens our perspective so much

939
00:58:46,473 --> 00:58:49,421
Speaker 1: and awakens us to the shocking reality of a

940
00:58:49,481 --> 00:58:52,258
Speaker 1: part of this and conceivably vast process

941
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:59,095
Speaker 1: that desperately needs us to be conscious

942
00:58:59,216 --> 00:58:59,377
Speaker 1: of it.

943
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:10,781
Speaker 1: Sometimes, when I think in a in a mythic

944
00:59:10,821 --> 00:59:15,854
Speaker 1: context, in a mythic, anthropocentric way,

945
00:59:15,894 --> 00:59:17,938
Speaker 1: about the nature of the absolute principle

946
00:59:17,978 --> 00:59:20,083
Speaker 1: or the God principle, just for fun,

947
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:23,734
Speaker 1: sometimes I choose to think about the

948
00:59:23,754 --> 00:59:24,659
Speaker 1: nature of the absolute principle or the God

949
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,162
Speaker 1: principle just for fun.

950
00:59:25,182 --> 00:59:25,947
Speaker 1: Sometimes I choose to think about the

951
00:59:25,967 --> 00:59:27,953
Speaker 1: nature of the God principle as an

952
00:59:28,013 --> 00:59:31,560
Speaker 1: anthropomorphic form, just as a

953
00:59:32,542 --> 00:59:33,704
Speaker 1: metaphysical exercise.

954
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:37,617
Speaker 1: So in that context, sometimes I imagine how,

955
00:59:37,697 --> 00:59:42,056
Speaker 1: if I was her, I'm being politically correct.

956
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:46,674
Speaker 1: Sometimes I imagine, if I was her, how

957
00:59:46,774 --> 00:59:48,560
Speaker 1: desperate I would be for my children to

958
00:59:51,698 --> 00:59:57,013
Speaker 1: wake up and to see me, because I knew, as

959
00:59:57,073 --> 00:59:59,600
Speaker 1: long as they could see me, there would be

960
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,674
Speaker 1: hope for the future.

961
01:00:00,694 --> 01:00:01,899
Speaker 1: But as long as they could see me there

962
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,969
Speaker 1: would be hope for the future.

963
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:05,776
Speaker 1: But as long as they couldn't really see me

964
01:00:05,796 --> 01:00:08,919
Speaker 1: clearly and feel me and know who I was,

965
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:13,780
Speaker 1: they would remain lost in delusion.

966
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,332
Speaker 1: So that's an anthropocentric contemplation.

967
01:00:27,352 --> 01:00:28,153
Speaker 1: But we don't have to think about it that

968
01:00:28,173 --> 01:00:28,233
Speaker 1: way.

969
01:00:28,253 --> 01:00:29,115
Speaker 1: We can say the reality of consciousness is

970
01:00:29,135 --> 01:00:30,518
Speaker 1: desperate for its own self-recognition.

971
01:00:34,706 --> 01:00:36,289
Speaker 1: The same thing, very good.

972
01:00:40,463 --> 01:00:41,667
Speaker 1: So I'm going to stop myself now.

973
01:00:41,687 --> 01:00:42,349
Speaker 1: But it's some kind of rambling.

974
01:00:42,369 --> 01:00:43,734
Speaker 1: Very good, so I'm going to stop myself now

975
01:00:43,755 --> 01:00:44,718
Speaker 1: because I'm kind of rambling.

976
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:48,640
Speaker 1: So I made the fundamental point I was

977
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:52,754
Speaker 1: trying to make, and the fundamental point

978
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,375
Speaker 1: was that your soul, or what we're calling

979
01:00:54,395 --> 01:01:13,430
Speaker 1: the soul, your soul, my soul, the soul, its

980
01:01:13,451 --> 01:01:14,195
Speaker 1: capacity for it, identifies with where

981
01:01:14,215 --> 01:01:15,059
Speaker 1: you're at in terms of the stage of

982
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:15,904
Speaker 1: development you're at, from egocentric,

983
01:01:15,924 --> 01:01:16,648
Speaker 1: ethnocentric, to world-centric, to

984
01:01:16,668 --> 01:01:16,950
Speaker 1: cosmos-centric.

985
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:19,294
Speaker 1: So what your soul will be capable of in

986
01:01:19,314 --> 01:01:22,703
Speaker 1: terms of identifying with what's most

987
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,173
Speaker 1: important will depend upon which stage of

988
01:01:24,193 --> 01:01:25,596
Speaker 1: development you're at as an evolving

989
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:28,764
Speaker 1: consciousness.

990
01:02:02,601 --> 01:02:04,122
Speaker 1: And remember that the soul is the deepest

991
01:02:04,142 --> 01:02:04,642
Speaker 1: part of the self.

992
01:02:04,662 --> 01:02:05,383
Speaker 1: It's still personal.

993
01:02:08,007 --> 01:02:09,493
Speaker 1: The ego is purely personal.

994
01:02:10,965 --> 01:02:13,294
Speaker 1: The frontal self or ego is purely personal.

995
01:02:16,726 --> 01:02:18,933
Speaker 1: So the soul is a much deeper part of who

996
01:02:18,973 --> 01:02:22,348
Speaker 1: you are and who I am, but it's still

997
01:02:22,629 --> 01:02:24,114
Speaker 1: personal because it's still about that

998
01:02:24,154 --> 01:02:25,188
Speaker 1: which experiences birth and death.

999
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:25,951
Speaker 1: It's going through, because it's still

1000
01:02:25,972 --> 01:02:27,639
Speaker 1: about that which experiences birth and

1001
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:27,900
Speaker 1: death.

1002
01:02:29,766 --> 01:02:31,292
Speaker 1: It's going through a process of change.

1003
01:02:34,826 --> 01:02:37,953
Speaker 1: The true self, your true self and my true

1004
01:02:37,993 --> 01:02:39,537
Speaker 1: self, is the deepest dimension of who you

1005
01:02:39,597 --> 01:02:40,990
Speaker 1: are, the deepest dimension of your reality

1006
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:44,032
Speaker 1: self, and it's never born and never dies,

1007
01:02:46,546 --> 01:02:48,170
Speaker 1: and it's therefore eternal and therefore

1008
01:02:49,735 --> 01:02:50,597
Speaker 1: has no preferences.

1009
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:54,647
Speaker 1: So the true self doesn't care, your true

1010
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:55,390
Speaker 1: self doesn't care.

1011
01:02:56,587 --> 01:02:57,370
Speaker 1: That's why it's free.

1012
01:03:07,489 --> 01:03:08,993
Speaker 1: That's why we could say that it might be

1013
01:03:09,033 --> 01:03:10,918
Speaker 1: more important to have an awakened soul

1014
01:03:48,184 --> 01:03:49,925
Speaker 1: than awakening to deeper and higher

1015
01:03:50,325 --> 01:03:51,487
Speaker 1: capacities for care.

1016
01:03:54,826 --> 01:03:56,153
Speaker 1: I think awakening to deeper and higher

1017
01:03:56,173 --> 01:03:57,962
Speaker 1: capacities for care is more important than

1018
01:03:57,982 --> 01:03:59,486
Speaker 1: the experience of inner freedom.

1019
01:04:18,281 --> 01:04:20,683
Speaker 1: Care and awakening to deeper and higher

1020
01:04:20,703 --> 01:04:23,485
Speaker 1: capacity for care can be an enormous burden,

1021
01:04:26,412 --> 01:04:30,848
Speaker 1: because if you care, if you really care, if

1022
01:04:30,889 --> 01:04:32,486
Speaker 1: you allow yourself to care that much and to

1023
01:04:32,506 --> 01:04:33,786
Speaker 1: experience that much care, it means you're

1024
01:04:33,806 --> 01:04:34,971
Speaker 1: going to have to do something about it,

1025
01:04:38,146 --> 01:04:42,189
Speaker 1: whereas if you are merely free, you don't

1026
01:04:42,229 --> 01:04:42,711
Speaker 1: have to care.

1027
01:04:44,586 --> 01:04:50,147
Speaker 1: So sometimes, paradoxically, the pursuit of

1028
01:04:50,187 --> 01:04:54,646
Speaker 1: freedom for its own sake can be, can

1029
01:04:54,687 --> 01:04:57,674
Speaker 1: inhibit certain kinds of spiritual

1030
01:04:57,714 --> 01:04:58,256
Speaker 1: development.

1031
01:04:58,316 --> 01:05:10,245
Speaker 1: Believe it or not, very good.

1032
01:05:10,266 --> 01:05:11,088
Speaker 1: So I'm going to stop talking now and then,

1033
01:05:11,108 --> 01:05:12,071
Speaker 1: in a couple of minutes, I can try and

1034
01:05:12,091 --> 01:05:13,455
Speaker 1: answer some questions, if you'd like.

1035
01:05:21,806 --> 01:05:23,170
Speaker 1: Let's hope we all will aspire to become

1036
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:31,918
Speaker 1: soulful people, soul full people, soul full

1037
01:05:31,938 --> 01:05:37,078
Speaker 1: of soul, bursting with soul.

1038
01:09:16,732 --> 01:09:18,255
Speaker 3: Soul is care and care is soul.

1039
01:09:18,275 --> 01:09:19,216
Speaker 3: Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1040
01:09:19,236 --> 01:09:20,078
Speaker 3: So does anybody have any questions?

1041
01:09:20,098 --> 01:09:21,200
Speaker 3: Yeah, there are a few here, and please

1042
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:23,745
Speaker 3: write your questions in the chat box at the

1043
01:09:23,765 --> 01:09:24,946
Speaker 3: bottom of the Zoom window.

1044
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:43,257
Speaker 3: So Edwin is asking.

1045
01:09:43,297 --> 01:09:51,393
Speaker 1: Let me just find him Does

1046
01:09:51,413 --> 01:09:53,024
Speaker 1: self-transcendence lead to soul or to the

1047
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:53,245
Speaker 1: true self?

1048
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:56,550
Speaker 1: It usually leads to the true self.

1049
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:57,813
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess it all depends upon who

1050
01:09:57,833 --> 01:09:59,195
Speaker 1: you're speaking to and how they define

1051
01:09:59,717 --> 01:10:08,007
Speaker 1: these terms, because not everybody uses

1052
01:10:08,048 --> 01:10:09,733
Speaker 1: these terms in the same way to mean the

1053
01:10:09,753 --> 01:10:09,993
Speaker 1: same thing.

1054
01:10:10,013 --> 01:10:11,778
Speaker 1: But generally speaking, my understanding of

1055
01:10:11,798 --> 01:10:12,801
Speaker 1: self-transcendence is the transcending the

1056
01:10:12,821 --> 01:10:13,644
Speaker 1: egoic consciousness to the, to the

1057
01:10:13,664 --> 01:10:16,008
Speaker 1: awareness of the ground of being, to

1058
01:10:16,048 --> 01:10:16,469
Speaker 1: eternity.

1059
01:10:16,529 --> 01:10:21,858
Speaker 1: Consciousness, that's, from being trapped

1060
01:10:21,898 --> 01:10:24,209
Speaker 1: in the ego's world of rampant fear and

1061
01:10:24,229 --> 01:10:28,784
Speaker 1: desire to awakening to eternity beyond any

1062
01:10:28,804 --> 01:10:30,388
Speaker 1: sense of being a unique individual.

1063
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:36,473
Speaker 1: That's what's so liberating about

1064
01:10:36,513 --> 01:10:38,540
Speaker 1: transcendence is when we experience the

1065
01:10:39,383 --> 01:10:41,126
Speaker 1: true self on the ground of being, by the

1066
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:43,209
Speaker 1: context of eternity.

1067
01:10:46,032 --> 01:10:48,395
Speaker 4: But doesn't one transcend?

1068
01:10:48,756 --> 01:10:52,941
Speaker 4: I mean, how does one move from ego to soul

1069
01:10:52,981 --> 01:10:53,602
Speaker 4: consciousness?

1070
01:10:55,006 --> 01:10:57,212
Speaker 4: There's not a transcendence, or how would

1071
01:10:57,232 --> 01:10:58,556
Speaker 4: you describe that shift?

1072
01:11:02,687 --> 01:11:04,996
Speaker 1: You don't have your screen on Edwin.

1073
01:11:05,016 --> 01:11:08,928
Speaker 1: Oh, I'll put your screen on Edwin.

1074
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:12,034
Speaker 4: Oh, can I put your screen on please?

1075
01:11:12,054 --> 01:11:12,415
Speaker 4: Sorry, I do.

1076
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:12,976
Speaker 4: Sorry it was off.

1077
01:11:12,996 --> 01:11:13,798
Speaker 1: That's okay.

1078
01:11:13,818 --> 01:11:17,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I think that the soul is

1079
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:26,472
Speaker 1: something that we have to work for and

1080
01:11:26,492 --> 01:11:28,588
Speaker 1: something that either we will either we

1081
01:11:28,628 --> 01:11:31,068
Speaker 1: will realize it on our own accord, or

1082
01:11:31,088 --> 01:11:32,493
Speaker 1: someone is going to have to point it out to

1083
01:11:32,614 --> 01:11:37,396
Speaker 1: us, because some people are focused mainly

1084
01:11:37,577 --> 01:11:41,618
Speaker 1: on the experience of transcendence and

1085
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:43,330
Speaker 1: inner freedom and are not very concerned

1086
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:49,591
Speaker 1: about the cultivation of their souls yeah,

1087
01:11:49,712 --> 01:11:52,536
Speaker 1: I no, I really appreciate your, your talk

1088
01:11:52,576 --> 01:11:55,020
Speaker 1: about soul today, because I think I, you

1089
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:57,169
Speaker 1: know, I use the term true self.

1090
01:11:57,209 --> 01:12:00,054
Speaker 4: Richard roar uses true self a lot and so I,

1091
01:12:01,076 --> 01:12:03,927
Speaker 4: I just uh was using true self as uh

1092
01:12:04,008 --> 01:12:06,393
Speaker 4: transcending ego to you know, know your

1093
01:12:06,433 --> 01:12:09,787
Speaker 4: true self, which you really I think it's

1094
01:12:09,807 --> 01:12:12,814
Speaker 4: really ego, soul that you're talking about.

1095
01:12:12,894 --> 01:12:14,538
Speaker 4: So thank you for that distinction.

1096
01:12:14,598 --> 01:12:15,326
Speaker 4: That's very helpful.

1097
01:12:15,827 --> 01:12:16,449
Speaker 1: Well, I'm making.

1098
01:12:16,589 --> 01:12:18,674
Speaker 1: I'm making a clear distinction in this.

1099
01:12:18,894 --> 01:12:21,146
Speaker 1: This is my mid evening from here, so I'm

1100
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:24,612
Speaker 1: making a distinction between true self and

1101
01:12:24,712 --> 01:12:25,093
Speaker 1: soul.

1102
01:12:25,534 --> 01:12:27,998
Speaker 1: But there are some people who,

1103
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:33,896
Speaker 1: understandably, could understand the true

1104
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:35,319
Speaker 1: self and soul are not separate.

1105
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:40,454
Speaker 1: But in my experience, in the way that I

1106
01:12:40,494 --> 01:12:43,751
Speaker 1: think about it, the soul is the

1107
01:12:44,071 --> 01:12:47,639
Speaker 1: metaphysical organ that transmigrates.

1108
01:12:48,627 --> 01:12:57,158
Speaker 1: It's my understanding and that it's a part

1109
01:12:57,178 --> 01:13:00,505
Speaker 1: of us that's been involved in this process

1110
01:13:00,786 --> 01:13:02,994
Speaker 1: as an evolving entity for a very long time

1111
01:13:05,567 --> 01:13:07,133
Speaker 1: and it's a deepest part of the self.

1112
01:13:07,173 --> 01:13:08,036
Speaker 1: It's still personal.

1113
01:13:08,638 --> 01:13:11,328
Speaker 4: You need to identify it with care, which

1114
01:13:11,348 --> 01:13:13,696
Speaker 4: then leads to action, whereas the danger of

1115
01:13:13,716 --> 01:13:16,385
Speaker 4: just like transcending to his suit to self

1116
01:13:16,505 --> 01:13:18,771
Speaker 4: could be this kind of being just a hermit

1117
01:13:18,851 --> 01:13:21,157
Speaker 4: and without a care for the world, and kind

1118
01:13:21,197 --> 01:13:24,730
Speaker 4: of thing yeah, the great trunk for you to

1119
01:13:24,751 --> 01:13:26,434
Speaker 4: define the ccl.

1120
01:13:28,557 --> 01:13:29,779
Speaker 1: Ccl means couldn't care less.

1121
01:13:32,412 --> 01:13:36,430
Speaker 1: Ccl means couldn't care less, because the

1122
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:39,136
Speaker 1: point is when, when we awaken to the free,

1123
01:13:39,156 --> 01:13:44,733
Speaker 1: the freedom of the true self, we, you enter

1124
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:45,936
Speaker 1: into a state of consciousness that's

1125
01:13:45,976 --> 01:13:47,499
Speaker 1: timeless and formless and beginningless and

1126
01:13:47,545 --> 01:13:49,571
Speaker 1: endless and eternal and birthless and

1127
01:13:49,611 --> 01:13:51,536
Speaker 1: deathless and absolutely free from karma.

1128
01:13:53,349 --> 01:13:54,753
Speaker 1: And in that state, in the, in the

1129
01:13:54,793 --> 01:13:57,149
Speaker 1: intoxicating ecstasy of that state, which

1130
01:13:57,210 --> 01:13:58,965
Speaker 1: is utterly and completely delightful,

1131
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:04,757
Speaker 1: there's nothing wrong, yeah, and there are

1132
01:14:04,797 --> 01:14:06,540
Speaker 1: no problems to solve or overcome, because

1133
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:09,386
Speaker 1: you are immersed in the conscious awareness

1134
01:14:09,466 --> 01:14:14,516
Speaker 1: of absolute, unqualifiable, radical Is-ness

1135
01:14:15,358 --> 01:14:17,141
Speaker 1: in all directions simultaneously.

1136
01:14:18,688 --> 01:14:22,074
Speaker 1: You're so absorbed in pure Is-ness that

1137
01:14:22,094 --> 01:14:25,179
Speaker 1: there is simply nothing to be done, because

1138
01:14:25,259 --> 01:14:26,608
Speaker 1: everything always is.

1139
01:14:31,865 --> 01:14:37,024
Speaker 1: And in that isness, is total, unconditional

1140
01:14:37,044 --> 01:14:37,264
Speaker 1: liberation.

1141
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,242
Speaker 1: Thank you.

1142
01:14:46,865 --> 01:14:48,902
Speaker 1: So you can see, edwin, that depending upon

1143
01:14:48,758 --> 01:14:48,888
Speaker 1: how we look at all this, depending on how

1144
01:14:48,744 --> 01:14:49,190
Speaker 1: we look about it, depending upon how we,

1145
01:14:50,913 --> 01:14:56,921
Speaker 1: what our values are, enlightenment could be

1146
01:14:56,981 --> 01:15:00,045
Speaker 1: seen as potentially, if it happens to the

1147
01:15:00,085 --> 01:15:01,489
Speaker 1: wrong person at the wrong time in their

1148
01:15:01,549 --> 01:15:05,577
Speaker 1: evolutionary trajectory of becoming, could

1149
01:15:06,145 --> 01:15:07,952
Speaker 1: be dangerous and have even a negative

1150
01:15:07,992 --> 01:15:08,354
Speaker 1: effect.

1151
01:15:16,907 --> 01:15:17,530
Speaker 1: And how much do?

1152
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:21,413
Speaker 1: How much is any one of us capable of caring?

1153
01:15:23,767 --> 01:15:24,771
Speaker 1: How much do we want to care?

1154
01:15:25,946 --> 01:15:27,451
Speaker 1: How much do we want to be bothered with the

1155
01:15:27,471 --> 01:15:28,214
Speaker 1: burden of caring?

1156
01:15:31,045 --> 01:15:33,053
Speaker 1: Because caring takes heart and sometimes

1157
01:15:33,093 --> 01:15:33,554
Speaker 1: it's painful.

1158
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:47,092
Speaker 1: So if I don't care and I'm free, I'm a

1159
01:15:47,152 --> 01:15:49,156
Speaker 1: little bit better off, I guess, because I

1160
01:15:49,176 --> 01:15:50,379
Speaker 1: don't have to struggle with the burden of

1161
01:15:50,419 --> 01:15:50,639
Speaker 1: care.

1162
01:15:53,206 --> 01:15:53,547
Speaker 4: You know.

1163
01:15:53,567 --> 01:15:56,014
Speaker 4: To be honest, I think you know I try to get

1164
01:15:56,094 --> 01:15:56,996
Speaker 4: other people to care.

1165
01:15:58,606 --> 01:15:59,349
Speaker 4: Is that caring?

1166
01:15:59,409 --> 01:16:00,452
Speaker 4: Am I caring enough?

1167
01:16:00,633 --> 01:16:01,235
Speaker 4: I mean yeah.

1168
01:16:02,806 --> 01:16:03,188
Speaker 1: How much is enough?

1169
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:03,993
Speaker 1: Yeah, how much is enough?

1170
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,151
Speaker 1: Yeah, because from my understanding of the

1171
01:16:10,171 --> 01:16:11,433
Speaker 1: awakening perspective, it's only enough

1172
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:15,519
Speaker 1: when all the suffering, obsession, beings

1173
01:16:15,579 --> 01:16:17,061
Speaker 1: in the entire universe come to an end.

1174
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:26,582
Speaker 1: Only then is it enough.

1175
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:31,988
Speaker 1: And so what the small self can't handle is

1176
01:16:32,028 --> 01:16:32,811
Speaker 1: the overwhelming nature of reality.

1177
01:16:32,831 --> 01:16:33,955
Speaker 1: When we really let ourselves see and feel

1178
01:16:33,995 --> 01:16:36,483
Speaker 1: and understand this process, that works to

1179
01:16:36,503 --> 01:16:37,589
Speaker 1: do what Bob Kahn and Paras love.

1180
01:16:40,367 --> 01:16:42,210
Speaker 1: It breaks the set boundaries that the small

1181
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:48,771
Speaker 1: self creates to live within and it's

1182
01:16:48,811 --> 01:16:50,436
Speaker 1: overwhelming in every possible direction.

1183
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:56,648
Speaker 1: It makes the ego very uncomfortable and the

1184
01:16:56,708 --> 01:16:59,466
Speaker 1: ego wants to be comfortable, it doesn't

1185
01:16:59,486 --> 01:17:00,427
Speaker 1: want to be overwhelmed.

1186
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:13,841
Speaker 1: Very good, thank you, edwin.

1187
01:17:14,381 --> 01:17:19,473
Speaker 3: Thank you the next question is from simone

1188
01:17:19,814 --> 01:17:22,799
Speaker 3: uh, the friend of pulse andrew, if you look

1189
01:17:22,859 --> 01:17:23,099
Speaker 3: for her.

1190
01:17:25,149 --> 01:17:27,414
Speaker 3: How do we begin to discriminate the

1191
01:17:27,454 --> 01:17:29,586
Speaker 3: difference between the soul and the

1192
01:17:29,627 --> 01:17:30,330
Speaker 3: positive ego?

1193
01:17:33,766 --> 01:17:34,589
Speaker 1: Can you ask the question again?

1194
01:17:34,609 --> 01:17:34,950
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

1195
01:17:35,592 --> 01:17:38,751
Speaker 3: Yes, how do we begin to discriminate the

1196
01:17:38,832 --> 01:17:41,146
Speaker 3: difference between the soul and the

1197
01:17:41,226 --> 01:17:42,089
Speaker 3: positive ego?

1198
01:17:44,545 --> 01:17:46,673
Speaker 1: Well, that's a very good question.

1199
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:47,609
Speaker 1: It's very astute.

1200
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:49,046
Speaker 1: The thing is, the positive ego feels good

1201
01:17:49,066 --> 01:17:49,707
Speaker 1: about itself.

1202
01:17:54,474 --> 01:17:55,916
Speaker 1: So that's when I'm having a good day.

1203
01:17:57,678 --> 01:17:59,281
Speaker 1: So on a good, on a good, you know, because

1204
01:17:59,806 --> 01:18:01,932
Speaker 1: because somehow we can feel, we can feel

1205
01:18:01,972 --> 01:18:03,797
Speaker 1: crappy and lousy about ourselves, we can

1206
01:18:03,837 --> 01:18:06,874
Speaker 1: feel, you know, self-loathing and unworthy

1207
01:18:06,935 --> 01:18:08,529
Speaker 1: and self-hatred, as a lot of people do.

1208
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:10,374
Speaker 1: Or we can have a good day, we could feel

1209
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,027
Speaker 1: very positive, maybe did some good things,

1210
01:18:12,608 --> 01:18:15,214
Speaker 1: maybe we were creatively very productive

1211
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,665
Speaker 1: and done some great things and we could

1212
01:18:16,685 --> 01:18:17,546
Speaker 1: feel good about ourselves.

1213
01:18:17,987 --> 01:18:20,050
Speaker 1: So the positive ego feels good about itself.

1214
01:18:21,392 --> 01:18:26,579
Speaker 1: But the soul, soul cares about more than

1215
01:18:26,659 --> 01:18:27,921
Speaker 1: just itself.

1216
01:18:28,466 --> 01:18:34,133
Speaker 1: The soul cares about karma, cares about

1217
01:18:35,715 --> 01:18:37,918
Speaker 1: reality as a whole and our relationship to

1218
01:18:37,998 --> 01:18:38,038
Speaker 1: it.

1219
01:18:42,049 --> 01:18:43,694
Speaker 1: The positive ego and we all want to have a

1220
01:18:43,714 --> 01:18:44,315
Speaker 1: positive ego.

1221
01:18:45,005 --> 01:18:46,129
Speaker 1: I'm all for positive ego.

1222
01:18:47,232 --> 01:18:48,576
Speaker 1: Negative ego is what creates the problem.

1223
01:18:51,932 --> 01:18:57,333
Speaker 1: So positive ego is important, but the ego

1224
01:18:57,373 --> 01:18:58,576
Speaker 1: is still all about me, whereas with the

1225
01:18:58,616 --> 01:19:02,528
Speaker 1: soul you're always going to be aware of

1226
01:19:02,569 --> 01:19:04,296
Speaker 1: your relationship to life, with a capital L

1227
01:19:04,396 --> 01:19:07,149
Speaker 1: and karma with a capital K, and meaning and

1228
01:19:07,189 --> 01:19:09,316
Speaker 1: purpose with a capital M and P.

1229
01:19:11,749 --> 01:19:13,399
Speaker 1: So in the soul you're always going to see

1230
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:17,838
Speaker 1: yourself and your relationship to life in

1231
01:19:17,858 --> 01:19:19,986
Speaker 1: these bigger and bigger contexts and you're

1232
01:19:20,006 --> 01:19:24,497
Speaker 1: going to feel good about it or bad about it,

1233
01:19:24,645 --> 01:19:28,295
Speaker 1: or you're going to feel moved to want to

1234
01:19:28,335 --> 01:19:34,417
Speaker 1: respond because you're seeing your own

1235
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:36,706
Speaker 1: relationship, your place in reality, your

1236
01:19:36,726 --> 01:19:37,851
Speaker 1: relationship to reality, in a much bigger

1237
01:19:37,871 --> 01:19:38,052
Speaker 1: way.

1238
01:19:40,366 --> 01:19:41,952
Speaker 1: Positive ego doesn't necessarily do that,

1239
01:19:45,026 --> 01:19:45,748
Speaker 1: it's context.

1240
01:19:48,818 --> 01:19:51,065
Speaker 1: So we feel the larger context very deeply

1241
01:19:51,567 --> 01:19:54,552
Speaker 1: and it moves us, it touches us.

1242
01:19:59,295 --> 01:19:59,817
Speaker 1: Does that help?

1243
01:20:01,822 --> 01:20:04,393
Speaker 3: yes, I guess in a sense what I understand

1244
01:20:04,454 --> 01:20:07,567
Speaker 3: is that the positive ego in a way gives you

1245
01:20:07,688 --> 01:20:10,892
Speaker 3: feedback, but it doesn't help you zoom out

1246
01:20:11,133 --> 01:20:13,877
Speaker 3: or inspire you in a way.

1247
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:16,141
Speaker 3: Yeah, exactly.

1248
01:20:18,746 --> 01:20:20,573
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that the positive ego cares

1249
01:20:20,613 --> 01:20:21,235
Speaker 1: about itself.

1250
01:20:22,766 --> 01:20:27,733
Speaker 1: I'm a good person, I'm a capable person.

1251
01:20:27,753 --> 01:20:30,531
Speaker 1: I'm a capable person, I'm a smart person,

1252
01:20:31,766 --> 01:20:33,413
Speaker 1: I'm a kind person, I'm a generous person.

1253
01:20:36,789 --> 01:20:37,432
Speaker 1: It's all about me.

1254
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:41,092
Speaker 1: And if all those things are true about me,

1255
01:20:41,112 --> 01:20:41,554
Speaker 1: that's good.

1256
01:20:41,614 --> 01:20:42,055
Speaker 1: It's all good.

1257
01:20:42,095 --> 01:20:42,817
Speaker 1: It's all good news.

1258
01:20:44,346 --> 01:20:46,191
Speaker 1: The positive ego is how I feel about myself.

1259
01:20:46,211 --> 01:20:48,676
Speaker 1: It's all good news.

1260
01:20:48,696 --> 01:20:50,380
Speaker 1: The positive ego is how I feel about myself,

1261
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:56,288
Speaker 1: whereas with the soul, the soul is suddenly,

1262
01:20:56,328 --> 01:20:59,402
Speaker 1: you see your own unique self in

1263
01:20:59,422 --> 01:21:08,926
Speaker 1: relationship to the reality of karma and we

1264
01:21:08,966 --> 01:21:10,455
Speaker 1: could say big history, and you start

1265
01:21:10,475 --> 01:21:11,421
Speaker 1: feeling this overwhelming context in which

1266
01:21:11,441 --> 01:21:15,919
Speaker 1: you actually exist and then you start to

1267
01:21:15,939 --> 01:21:21,646
Speaker 1: see that the ego story is so small and when

1268
01:21:21,666 --> 01:21:22,448
Speaker 1: you awaken to the soul, you realize that

1269
01:21:22,468 --> 01:21:23,369
Speaker 1: the story that you have been immersed in

1270
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:25,594
Speaker 1: for God knows how long is profound and

1271
01:21:25,654 --> 01:21:29,041
Speaker 1: intense and overwhelmingly demanding.

1272
01:21:29,866 --> 01:21:31,492
Speaker 1: When we begin to feel it at the level of

1273
01:21:31,513 --> 01:21:33,028
Speaker 1: the soul, it's kind of all emotionally can

1274
01:21:33,048 --> 01:21:35,135
Speaker 1: be overwhelming in good ways and bad ways.

1275
01:21:37,426 --> 01:21:39,032
Speaker 1: But it's seeing much more of the truth with

1276
01:21:39,092 --> 01:21:45,909
Speaker 1: a capital T Because, for example, you know,

1277
01:21:45,929 --> 01:21:48,434
Speaker 1: when we have spiritual insights, a lot of

1278
01:21:48,595 --> 01:21:51,367
Speaker 1: people think about it in a crude way that

1279
01:21:51,387 --> 01:21:52,730
Speaker 1: everybody wants to be good with God.

1280
01:21:59,128 --> 01:22:01,331
Speaker 1: And when we start seeing the reality from

1281
01:22:01,351 --> 01:22:04,936
Speaker 1: the vantage point of our own in soul, we

1282
01:22:04,956 --> 01:22:09,361
Speaker 1: start seeing how we could have a much more,

1283
01:22:10,725 --> 01:22:12,189
Speaker 1: have a much deeper relationship to life.

1284
01:22:12,209 --> 01:22:15,277
Speaker 1: That expressed deep integrity.

1285
01:22:17,887 --> 01:22:22,019
Speaker 1: And I think integrity, from my perspective,

1286
01:22:23,306 --> 01:22:24,898
Speaker 1: is expressing how much we actually care

1287
01:22:24,938 --> 01:22:26,889
Speaker 1: about more than ourselves and actually

1288
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:30,414
Speaker 1: express it in the way we live our lives

1289
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:42,292
Speaker 1: thank you sure the next question is from

1290
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:42,753
Speaker 1: carrie.

1291
01:22:43,273 --> 01:22:46,577
Speaker 3: She's asking does the karmic field reside

1292
01:22:46,778 --> 01:22:49,401
Speaker 3: in the memory rather than in the soul?

1293
01:22:53,573 --> 01:22:54,855
Speaker 1: well, I mean, I don't really know the

1294
01:22:54,936 --> 01:22:56,519
Speaker 1: answer to the question, but I would say

1295
01:22:56,539 --> 01:22:58,347
Speaker 1: that the the memory we're speaking,

1296
01:22:58,407 --> 01:23:16,866
Speaker 1: personal memory, resides in the ego and the

1297
01:23:16,886 --> 01:23:18,387
Speaker 1: deeper memory resides in the soul.

1298
01:23:34,798 --> 01:23:37,820
Speaker 5: So how does one go about loosening the

1299
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:42,283
Speaker 5: connection to your imprints?

1300
01:23:44,568 --> 01:23:53,547
Speaker 5: To the what Carrie Sorry to the what Carrie,

1301
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:55,512
Speaker 5: sorry, the imprints of all the causes and

1302
01:23:55,533 --> 01:23:56,274
Speaker 5: conditions that come together.

1303
01:23:57,718 --> 01:23:58,661
Speaker 5: How can you loosen that, the ties to those

1304
01:23:58,681 --> 01:23:58,841
Speaker 5: imprints?

1305
01:23:58,881 --> 01:23:59,583
Speaker 1: the way we listen to.

1306
01:23:59,603 --> 01:24:01,387
Speaker 1: Well, the way that we loosen the ties is by

1307
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:04,354
Speaker 1: seeking to awaken to enlightened awareness,

1308
01:24:04,415 --> 01:24:06,830
Speaker 1: which is the deepest part of the self,

1309
01:24:07,091 --> 01:24:08,417
Speaker 1: which is which is the true self, and

1310
01:24:08,437 --> 01:24:09,602
Speaker 1: remember the which is the deepest part of

1311
01:24:09,662 --> 01:24:11,206
Speaker 1: the self, which is the true self, and

1312
01:24:11,226 --> 01:24:13,978
Speaker 1: remember the true self is the deepest and

1313
01:24:14,018 --> 01:24:15,284
Speaker 1: most authentic dimension of myself and

1314
01:24:15,324 --> 01:24:16,851
Speaker 1: yourself and of reality itself.

1315
01:24:18,507 --> 01:24:22,923
Speaker 1: But the true self is unattached and is

1316
01:24:23,004 --> 01:24:25,533
Speaker 1: eternal and therefore is unconditionally

1317
01:24:25,573 --> 01:24:25,854
Speaker 1: free.

1318
01:24:27,005 --> 01:24:30,314
Speaker 1: So if we dwell in the conscious awareness

1319
01:24:30,354 --> 01:24:33,368
Speaker 1: of our own true self, we will experience

1320
01:24:34,771 --> 01:24:37,417
Speaker 1: overwhelming freedom from all causes and

1321
01:24:37,457 --> 01:24:41,088
Speaker 1: effects, including all karmas.

1322
01:24:47,575 --> 01:24:49,858
Speaker 1: That's the relief.

1323
01:24:50,659 --> 01:24:51,940
Speaker 1: Awakening to enlightened awareness is the

1324
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:52,501
Speaker 1: only relief.

1325
01:24:59,815 --> 01:25:01,403
Speaker 1: So the practice of meditation is a form of

1326
01:25:01,423 --> 01:25:04,187
Speaker 1: purification If we're really meditating.

1327
01:25:04,207 --> 01:25:06,651
Speaker 1: Yes, meditating means letting go of our

1328
01:25:06,691 --> 01:25:08,914
Speaker 1: attachment, our attachments.

1329
01:25:08,974 --> 01:25:10,756
Speaker 1: If we're really letting go and letting go

1330
01:25:10,816 --> 01:25:12,198
Speaker 1: of our attachments, if we're really

1331
01:25:12,218 --> 01:25:17,186
Speaker 1: meditating, then the answer is yes, but

1332
01:25:17,206 --> 01:25:17,687
Speaker 1: it's not so.

1333
01:25:17,707 --> 01:25:21,214
Speaker 1: Yes, it's a practice of purification, but

1334
01:25:21,234 --> 01:25:22,236
Speaker 1: it's also a practice of cultivating

1335
01:25:22,477 --> 01:25:23,379
Speaker 1: spiritual strength.

1336
01:25:26,647 --> 01:25:28,269
Speaker 1: Because the I'm contradicting what I said

1337
01:25:28,309 --> 01:25:29,290
Speaker 1: earlier, Because the less I'm contradicting

1338
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:30,712
Speaker 1: what I said earlier I know that, but not

1339
01:25:30,732 --> 01:25:30,853
Speaker 1: less.

1340
01:25:30,873 --> 01:25:31,914
Speaker 1: Nobody's perfect.

1341
01:25:31,934 --> 01:25:38,908
Speaker 1: But the more we can let go, the less

1342
01:25:38,928 --> 01:25:41,234
Speaker 1: frightened we're going to be of karma and

1343
01:25:41,295 --> 01:25:45,813
Speaker 1: of responsibility, because we'll be

1344
01:25:45,833 --> 01:25:47,206
Speaker 1: connected with the inherent freedom that is

1345
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:48,332
Speaker 1: the ground of all reality.

1346
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:55,065
Speaker 1: So if we really learn how to let go and

1347
01:25:55,085 --> 01:25:57,986
Speaker 1: practice it diligently and do it just

1348
01:25:58,026 --> 01:25:59,351
Speaker 1: letting go is something you've got to do,

1349
01:25:59,431 --> 01:26:02,721
Speaker 1: we all have to do it it can become the

1350
01:26:02,762 --> 01:26:03,796
Speaker 1: source of what I call spiritual

1351
01:26:03,816 --> 01:26:07,171
Speaker 1: self-confidence, because spiritual

1352
01:26:07,191 --> 01:26:08,595
Speaker 1: self-confidence comes from the recognition

1353
01:26:08,615 --> 01:26:09,978
Speaker 1: that, at the deepest level, you are

1354
01:26:10,685 --> 01:26:12,510
Speaker 1: timeless and formless and beginningless and

1355
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:15,056
Speaker 1: endless and eternal and inherently free,

1356
01:26:15,076 --> 01:26:19,513
Speaker 1: with a capital F, and you know it and you

1357
01:26:19,593 --> 01:26:23,647
Speaker 1: radiate that truth, and that becomes a

1358
01:26:23,687 --> 01:26:27,496
Speaker 1: source of spiritual self-confidence If you

1359
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:28,037
Speaker 1: know it's true.

1360
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:33,737
Speaker 5: So this is a form of forgiveness.

1361
01:26:34,485 --> 01:26:36,489
Speaker 5: You forgive yourself for your past.

1362
01:26:36,910 --> 01:26:40,677
Speaker 1: If you've done past actions that are, you

1363
01:26:40,717 --> 01:26:43,469
Speaker 1: know, bad, Well, self-forgiveness is always

1364
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:45,314
Speaker 1: a good idea, but the awakening to the true

1365
01:26:45,354 --> 01:26:46,076
Speaker 1: self has nothing to do with

1366
01:26:46,116 --> 01:26:46,717
Speaker 1: self-forgiveness.

1367
01:26:46,805 --> 01:26:48,068
Speaker 1: It's awakening to the part of yourself that

1368
01:26:48,088 --> 01:26:50,973
Speaker 1: has never been born, never entered the

1369
01:26:50,993 --> 01:26:52,777
Speaker 1: stream of time, is always inherently free,

1370
01:26:52,837 --> 01:26:53,799
Speaker 1: so there's nothing to forgive.

1371
01:26:53,885 --> 01:26:55,191
Speaker 1: If nothing ever happens, there's nothing to

1372
01:26:55,211 --> 01:26:55,432
Speaker 1: forgive.

1373
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:05,949
Speaker 5: So you're always looking forward, and not

1374
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:17,715
Speaker 5: to the past or no, you learn from the past,

1375
01:27:17,815 --> 01:27:18,576
Speaker 5: but you can.

1376
01:27:18,957 --> 01:27:23,765
Speaker 5: You set your sights forward into evolution.

1377
01:27:25,489 --> 01:27:26,953
Speaker 1: That would be a very wholesome attitude, I

1378
01:27:26,994 --> 01:27:31,322
Speaker 1: think, a wholesome perspective a wholesome

1379
01:27:31,342 --> 01:27:31,645
Speaker 1: orientation now.

1380
01:27:36,285 --> 01:27:37,188
Speaker 1: Anna, letting go of the past and having a

1381
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:38,713
Speaker 1: positive evolutionary orientation to the

1382
01:27:38,774 --> 01:27:38,994
Speaker 1: future.

1383
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:40,247
Speaker 1: That sounds like something I would like to

1384
01:27:40,287 --> 01:27:40,467
Speaker 1: do.

1385
01:27:49,279 --> 01:27:50,420
Speaker 1: So that's why, kari, as I think you're

1386
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:52,929
Speaker 1: aware, in the teaching of evolutionary

1387
01:27:52,949 --> 01:27:53,794
Speaker 1: enlightenment we have what's called the

1388
01:27:53,814 --> 01:27:54,799
Speaker 1: authentic self, the evolutionary impulse.

1389
01:27:56,428 --> 01:27:57,879
Speaker 1: And the evolutionary impulse, which is the

1390
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:59,167
Speaker 1: energy and intelligence that created the

1391
01:27:59,227 --> 01:28:01,834
Speaker 1: universe, is the experience of pure

1392
01:28:01,895 --> 01:28:02,537
Speaker 1: positivity.

1393
01:28:06,327 --> 01:28:08,071
Speaker 1: It's the felt sense of recognition that all

1394
01:28:08,111 --> 01:28:08,913
Speaker 1: things are possible.

1395
01:28:10,337 --> 01:28:12,430
Speaker 1: And when you are awake to the evolutionary

1396
01:28:12,490 --> 01:28:13,974
Speaker 1: impulse, when I'm awake to the evolutionary

1397
01:28:14,015 --> 01:28:16,950
Speaker 1: impulse, the feeling, experience and state

1398
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:20,197
Speaker 1: of consciousness is that all things are

1399
01:28:20,257 --> 01:28:20,738
Speaker 1: possible.

1400
01:28:21,078 --> 01:28:22,608
Speaker 1: It's the experience of pure positivity.

1401
01:28:24,573 --> 01:28:26,196
Speaker 1: It's a pure positivity that's a catalyst

1402
01:28:26,216 --> 01:28:26,958
Speaker 1: for creativity.

1403
01:28:29,545 --> 01:28:35,052
Speaker 1: Positivity, it's a pure positivity that's a

1404
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:35,553
Speaker 1: catalyst for creativity.

1405
01:28:35,573 --> 01:28:36,715
Speaker 1: It's the feeling that all things are

1406
01:28:36,735 --> 01:28:36,995
Speaker 1: possible.

1407
01:28:37,015 --> 01:28:40,399
Speaker 1: When we get into a flow of spontaneous

1408
01:28:40,439 --> 01:28:42,047
Speaker 1: creativity, that's where we're overwhelmed

1409
01:28:42,088 --> 01:28:43,555
Speaker 1: with the sense that all things are possible,

1410
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,187
Speaker 1: which is the experience of pure positivity.

1411
01:28:46,207 --> 01:28:47,692
Speaker 1: There's nothing in the way and all things

1412
01:28:47,733 --> 01:28:48,315
Speaker 1: are possible.

1413
01:28:48,925 --> 01:28:50,191
Speaker 1: There's no doubt and there's no fear.

1414
01:28:53,186 --> 01:28:54,992
Speaker 1: That's what the evolutionary impulse feels

1415
01:28:55,073 --> 01:28:56,712
Speaker 1: like, feels like pure positivity.

1416
01:29:02,027 --> 01:29:03,820
Speaker 1: And when I feel, when I'm awake to the

1417
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:05,388
Speaker 1: evolutionary impulse and I feel that all

1418
01:29:05,409 --> 01:29:06,822
Speaker 1: things are possible and you're awake to the

1419
01:29:06,761 --> 01:29:07,557
Speaker 1: evolutionary impulse and I feel that all

1420
01:29:07,496 --> 01:29:08,069
Speaker 1: things are possible and you're awake to the

1421
01:29:08,007 --> 01:29:09,013
Speaker 1: evolutionary impulse and you feel that all

1422
01:29:09,033 --> 01:29:11,571
Speaker 1: things are possible, we're going to get

1423
01:29:11,611 --> 01:29:12,193
Speaker 1: along great.

1424
01:29:17,490 --> 01:29:19,135
Speaker 1: We will be fabulous co-creators.

1425
01:29:23,587 --> 01:29:25,223
Speaker 1: Now, if I'm awake to the evolutionary

1426
01:29:25,263 --> 01:29:25,979
Speaker 1: impulse and I'm convinced that all things

1427
01:29:25,917 --> 01:29:26,668
Speaker 1: are possible and I'm overwhelmed with the

1428
01:29:26,606 --> 01:29:27,221
Speaker 1: pure positivity to the evolutionary impulse,

1429
01:29:27,159 --> 01:29:27,489
Speaker 1: and I'm convinced that all things are

1430
01:29:27,427 --> 01:29:28,419
Speaker 1: possible and I'm overwhelmed with the pure

1431
01:29:28,439 --> 01:29:30,788
Speaker 1: positivity of the evolutionary impulse, and

1432
01:29:30,808 --> 01:29:33,773
Speaker 1: you're stuck in your fear.

1433
01:29:34,650 --> 01:29:36,119
Speaker 1: You or anyone else would be trapped in the

1434
01:29:36,401 --> 01:29:40,352
Speaker 1: fear-ridden, doubt-laden, nihilistic,

1435
01:29:43,334 --> 01:29:44,036
Speaker 1: wounded ego.

1436
01:29:45,309 --> 01:29:46,914
Speaker 1: We're not going to be able to create much

1437
01:29:46,954 --> 01:29:47,515
Speaker 1: together, are we?

1438
01:29:49,366 --> 01:29:50,811
Speaker 1: Because I'll be wearing to go and you'll be

1439
01:29:50,831 --> 01:29:51,634
Speaker 1: licking your wounds.

1440
01:29:52,746 --> 01:29:54,327
Speaker 1: I don't mean you being you, I'm just using

1441
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:55,992
Speaker 1: you as a metaphorically.

1442
01:29:56,213 --> 01:29:56,855
Speaker 1: You get my point.

1443
01:30:00,546 --> 01:30:01,886
Speaker 1: That's why, to create a new world, we all

1444
01:30:01,906 --> 01:30:04,530
Speaker 1: have to get over ourselves so we can do

1445
01:30:04,571 --> 01:30:06,870
Speaker 1: beautiful things together on the vantage

1446
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:08,507
Speaker 1: point of the authentic self of the

1447
01:30:08,547 --> 01:30:09,288
Speaker 1: evolutionary impulse.

1448
01:30:09,308 --> 01:30:15,678
Speaker 5: Now, right, Easy to say, but it's not

1449
01:30:15,758 --> 01:30:16,860
Speaker 5: always hard to do.

1450
01:30:17,265 --> 01:30:22,370
Speaker 5: It's often hard to do because things happen

1451
01:30:22,570 --> 01:30:30,157
Speaker 5: around you and trigger the illness in you

1452
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:35,122
Speaker 5: and you have to wait it out until you get

1453
01:30:35,182 --> 01:30:37,587
Speaker 5: back to a place of positivity again.

1454
01:30:38,548 --> 01:30:38,908
Speaker 1: That's right.

1455
01:30:38,928 --> 01:30:39,289
Speaker 1: We Thank you.

1456
01:30:39,309 --> 01:30:39,949
Speaker 1: Nice to see you again, Kerry.

1457
01:30:53,129 --> 01:30:53,593
Speaker 5: Thank you.

1458
01:30:54,098 --> 01:30:54,925
Speaker 5: How are the dogs?

1459
01:30:57,158 --> 01:30:58,225
Speaker 1: Very good Happy campers.

1460
01:30:59,328 --> 01:31:08,359
Speaker 3: Great, thank you so the next question is

1461
01:31:08,479 --> 01:31:09,420
Speaker 3: from lorraine.

1462
01:31:10,721 --> 01:31:13,042
Speaker 3: She's asking have you experienced that the

1463
01:31:13,102 --> 01:31:15,683
Speaker 3: true self is the best guide for carrying

1464
01:31:15,843 --> 01:31:16,143
Speaker 3: action?

1465
01:31:20,196 --> 01:31:25,996
Speaker 1: no, no, no.

1466
01:31:26,016 --> 01:31:27,479
Speaker 1: In my experience, what I'm, what I've been

1467
01:31:27,499 --> 01:31:30,725
Speaker 1: describing in this talk, is the awakened

1468
01:31:31,827 --> 01:31:34,232
Speaker 1: soul is the best guide for carrying action,

1469
01:31:35,975 --> 01:31:43,057
Speaker 1: the being guided by the soul, felt urgings.

1470
01:31:45,591 --> 01:31:47,395
Speaker 1: What's the best guide for what kind of

1471
01:31:47,475 --> 01:31:47,696
Speaker 1: action?

1472
01:31:47,716 --> 01:31:52,287
Speaker 7: I'm sorry just caring action.

1473
01:31:53,189 --> 01:31:55,677
Speaker 7: It's easy to care about so many things I'm

1474
01:31:55,717 --> 01:31:59,329
Speaker 7: sorry, my picture doesn't work, my that

1475
01:31:59,369 --> 01:32:02,639
Speaker 7: doesn't work so it's easy to care about so

1476
01:32:02,679 --> 01:32:05,288
Speaker 7: many things that I found that I can get

1477
01:32:05,428 --> 01:32:09,024
Speaker 7: overwhelmed and super extended because I

1478
01:32:09,044 --> 01:32:10,890
Speaker 7: care about different things, different

1479
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:14,842
Speaker 7: people, and so sometimes it's I have

1480
01:32:14,922 --> 01:32:16,787
Speaker 7: overextended myself, and so I just wondered

1481
01:32:19,111 --> 01:32:22,436
Speaker 7: where you find, if you find, a boundary so

1482
01:32:22,477 --> 01:32:26,146
Speaker 7: that you don't wear yourself down or then

1483
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,552
Speaker 7: you need to be meditating more deeply,

1484
01:32:29,407 --> 01:32:31,352
Speaker 7: awakening to the true self and experiencing

1485
01:32:32,074 --> 01:32:32,957
Speaker 7: the freedom of being.

1486
01:32:35,366 --> 01:32:38,455
Speaker 7: Okay, I guess that's my answer and I

1487
01:32:38,495 --> 01:32:39,016
Speaker 7: appreciate it.

1488
01:32:41,526 --> 01:32:43,112
Speaker 1: That's how we recharge our metaphysical

1489
01:32:43,132 --> 01:32:43,554
Speaker 1: batteries.

1490
01:32:45,526 --> 01:32:48,455
Speaker 7: Yeah, and I probably got to a place where I

1491
01:32:48,495 --> 01:32:52,472
Speaker 7: didn't have that time for myself enough and

1492
01:32:52,512 --> 01:32:56,018
Speaker 7: I'm so I really I just super appreciate you

1493
01:32:56,058 --> 01:33:00,069
Speaker 7: talking about caring, because it's when

1494
01:33:00,129 --> 01:33:04,154
Speaker 7: it's just comes naturally and I can't say

1495
01:33:04,294 --> 01:33:06,997
Speaker 7: ego's involved, because you're just, it's

1496
01:33:07,058 --> 01:33:10,161
Speaker 7: just your heart, it's just your soul

1497
01:33:10,505 --> 01:33:12,889
Speaker 7: sometimes that just speaks to you to care

1498
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:20,479
Speaker 7: and and I, um yeah, it's a humbling thing

1499
01:33:20,579 --> 01:33:21,501
Speaker 7: actually for me.

1500
01:33:22,426 --> 01:33:23,829
Speaker 7: So, but, thank you so much.

1501
01:33:24,049 --> 01:33:26,293
Speaker 7: This has been how you broke things down,

1502
01:33:26,373 --> 01:33:29,058
Speaker 7: has been really good for me.

1503
01:33:29,939 --> 01:33:30,340
Speaker 7: Thank you.

1504
01:33:32,527 --> 01:33:35,369
Speaker 7: So bless you, bless everybody on here.

1505
01:33:36,774 --> 01:33:37,155
Speaker 1: Thank you.

1506
01:33:40,887 --> 01:33:44,410
Speaker 3: So almost at the end, you want to take one

1507
01:33:44,430 --> 01:33:45,494
Speaker 3: more question from Paul?

1508
01:33:46,286 --> 01:33:46,586
Speaker 1: Sure.

1509
01:33:49,432 --> 01:33:52,537
Speaker 3: He is asking, you are speaking about the

1510
01:33:52,597 --> 01:33:55,263
Speaker 3: soul as an aspect of the self which is

1511
01:33:55,363 --> 01:33:58,709
Speaker 3: imbued with a kind of implicit wisdom and

1512
01:33:58,769 --> 01:34:01,975
Speaker 3: intelligence, objectivity of ourselves and

1513
01:34:02,055 --> 01:34:05,427
Speaker 3: life, but also a developing intelligence,

1514
01:34:06,249 --> 01:34:08,856
Speaker 3: and that some things that our soul felt can

1515
01:34:08,956 --> 01:34:11,471
Speaker 3: even be motives of evil actions

1516
01:34:11,992 --> 01:34:13,757
Speaker 3: disconnected from a higher moral

1517
01:34:13,837 --> 01:34:14,479
Speaker 3: intelligence.

1518
01:34:15,321 --> 01:34:17,326
Speaker 3: It seems like there's a choosing faculty,

1519
01:34:17,407 --> 01:34:20,573
Speaker 3: but also a way that we interpret the soul's

1520
01:34:20,693 --> 01:34:23,518
Speaker 3: implicit wisdom and intelligence at higher

1521
01:34:23,578 --> 01:34:23,939
Speaker 3: levels.

1522
01:34:24,687 --> 01:34:27,393
Speaker 3: What is it in us that is choosing what we

1523
01:34:27,473 --> 01:34:28,416
Speaker 3: identify with?

1524
01:34:29,245 --> 01:34:31,952
Speaker 3: What part of our experience is interpreting

1525
01:34:32,012 --> 01:34:33,276
Speaker 3: the soul's intelligence?

1526
01:34:34,807 --> 01:34:38,394
Speaker 1: Well, I think it depends, Paul, on the

1527
01:34:38,414 --> 01:34:39,917
Speaker 1: fundamental distinctions of egocentric,

1528
01:34:40,038 --> 01:34:41,227
Speaker 1: ethnocentric, world-centric and

1529
01:34:41,247 --> 01:34:41,930
Speaker 1: cosmocentric.

1530
01:34:42,885 --> 01:34:44,289
Speaker 1: So, for example, if you were at an

1531
01:34:45,271 --> 01:34:47,136
Speaker 1: ethnocentric level of development and you

1532
01:34:47,156 --> 01:34:51,879
Speaker 1: decided that the and you were and something

1533
01:34:51,899 --> 01:34:53,304
Speaker 1: terrible had happened to your tribe, then

1534
01:34:53,324 --> 01:34:54,969
Speaker 1: you might feel it was very appropriate to

1535
01:34:54,989 --> 01:35:01,034
Speaker 1: kind of go massacre the next tribe, and the

1536
01:35:01,094 --> 01:35:03,361
Speaker 1: intelligence and the logic of that level of

1537
01:35:03,381 --> 01:35:05,126
Speaker 1: development would very much make it clear

1538
01:35:05,146 --> 01:35:07,331
Speaker 1: to you that that was a doubtlessly the

1539
01:35:07,371 --> 01:35:08,032
Speaker 1: right thing to do.

1540
01:35:09,836 --> 01:35:12,241
Speaker 1: But as you, as we evolve to higher, higher

1541
01:35:12,281 --> 01:35:16,552
Speaker 1: levels of stage development, you begin to

1542
01:35:16,572 --> 01:35:19,181
Speaker 1: see these, these, these relative issues, in

1543
01:35:19,201 --> 01:35:20,465
Speaker 1: bigger and bigger contexts.

1544
01:35:21,247 --> 01:35:22,531
Speaker 1: The capacity to see them in bigger and

1545
01:35:22,551 --> 01:35:26,223
Speaker 1: bigger contexts awakens our capacity for

1546
01:35:26,263 --> 01:35:29,125
Speaker 1: our discrimination and more and greater

1547
01:35:29,165 --> 01:35:35,894
Speaker 1: intelligence um, I guess there's, uh,

1548
01:35:37,336 --> 01:35:39,539
Speaker 1: there's this way that I guess.

1549
01:35:39,959 --> 01:35:41,201
Speaker 6: Um, I'm interpreting my.

1550
01:35:41,365 --> 01:35:42,148
Speaker 6: You know experience of the soul, or, like

1551
01:35:42,168 --> 01:35:43,212
Speaker 6: you said, that, experience of a rude

1552
01:35:43,232 --> 01:35:43,433
Speaker 6: awakening.

1553
01:35:43,453 --> 01:35:44,557
Speaker 6: You know experience of the soul, or, like

1554
01:35:44,577 --> 01:35:46,483
Speaker 6: you said, that experience of a rude

1555
01:35:46,524 --> 01:35:47,886
Speaker 6: awakening you?

1556
01:35:47,906 --> 01:35:50,512
Speaker 6: know which is that sense of like sudden

1557
01:35:50,612 --> 01:35:52,436
Speaker 6: objectivity about oneself.

1558
01:35:52,957 --> 01:35:54,307
Speaker 6: You know, it's like seeing oneself

1559
01:35:54,427 --> 01:35:57,694
Speaker 6: incredibly clearly in a way that uh, it's

1560
01:35:57,714 --> 01:35:59,498
Speaker 6: kind of like uh, the warts and all

1561
01:36:00,086 --> 01:36:04,694
Speaker 6: experience and um, and, but in that

1562
01:36:04,894 --> 01:36:07,098
Speaker 6: experience of the rude awakening there's

1563
01:36:07,138 --> 01:36:09,507
Speaker 6: that, there's that sense of like a cosmic

1564
01:36:09,587 --> 01:36:10,228
Speaker 6: objectivity.

1565
01:36:11,049 --> 01:36:14,275
Speaker 6: You know, um, it's not rooted necessarily

1566
01:36:14,375 --> 01:36:20,654
Speaker 6: in my individual um, uh, unlimited to the

1567
01:36:20,674 --> 01:36:22,579
Speaker 6: value system, you know it's.

1568
01:36:22,739 --> 01:36:24,484
Speaker 6: It's kind of like I'm now seeing myself

1569
01:36:24,584 --> 01:36:28,033
Speaker 6: outside of my ego's kind of value system or

1570
01:36:28,073 --> 01:36:29,737
Speaker 6: construct, right, I'm no longer hiding.

1571
01:36:30,205 --> 01:36:31,929
Speaker 6: So it's like, in that no longer hiding,

1572
01:36:32,571 --> 01:36:35,097
Speaker 6: there's this intelligence that becomes

1573
01:36:35,297 --> 01:36:37,607
Speaker 6: active, there's a way of seeing clearly

1574
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:38,789
Speaker 6: that becomes active.

1575
01:36:41,852 --> 01:36:45,336
Speaker 6: So there's that sense of you know this

1576
01:36:45,557 --> 01:36:48,881
Speaker 6: simplistic quality of extraordinary wisdom.

1577
01:36:49,261 --> 01:36:56,806
Speaker 6: You know complete wisdom that sometimes can

1578
01:36:56,826 --> 01:36:57,627
Speaker 6: arise, for instance in meditation or in

1579
01:36:57,647 --> 01:36:58,569
Speaker 6: contemplation with others, that is sort of

1580
01:36:58,589 --> 01:36:59,570
Speaker 6: free from my.

1581
01:37:00,391 --> 01:37:03,816
Speaker 6: You know, individual ego in that way, ego

1582
01:37:04,237 --> 01:37:08,364
Speaker 6: in that way, and and it and it felt that,

1583
01:37:08,564 --> 01:37:10,448
Speaker 6: like the way that you were speaking to

1584
01:37:12,052 --> 01:37:13,957
Speaker 6: developing the soul or awakening the soul,

1585
01:37:13,997 --> 01:37:15,948
Speaker 6: it's kind of you're also stirring or

1586
01:37:15,988 --> 01:37:19,396
Speaker 6: awakening this extraordinary intelligence

1587
01:37:19,436 --> 01:37:21,649
Speaker 6: and wisdom to become even more active.

1588
01:37:22,651 --> 01:37:25,517
Speaker 6: You know, or an awakened aspect of our

1589
01:37:25,557 --> 01:37:25,898
Speaker 6: psyche.

1590
01:37:26,265 --> 01:37:27,613
Speaker 1: You know an awakened aspect of our psyche

1591
01:37:27,633 --> 01:37:29,323
Speaker 1: you know, this aspect of definitely and

1592
01:37:29,343 --> 01:37:31,390
Speaker 1: definitely, definitely, but I, I,

1593
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:32,914
Speaker 1: definitely, but in my, in my experience,

1594
01:37:32,934 --> 01:37:34,546
Speaker 1: what I was trying to describe, even though

1595
01:37:34,586 --> 01:37:37,615
Speaker 1: there is intelligence and self-reliance,

1596
01:37:37,655 --> 01:37:40,984
Speaker 1: self-reflectivity, self-reflectivity and

1597
01:37:41,004 --> 01:37:45,418
Speaker 1: having this kind of experience, I'm

1598
01:37:45,458 --> 01:37:50,578
Speaker 1: speaking more, more about a feeling in

1599
01:37:50,599 --> 01:37:54,569
Speaker 1: which there's enormous gravitas and

1600
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:59,316
Speaker 1: poignancy, about this larger context in

1601
01:37:59,336 --> 01:38:01,840
Speaker 1: which we see ourselves and it's it's the

1602
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:05,052
Speaker 1: sense of gravitas and emotional and there's

1603
01:38:05,072 --> 01:38:06,997
Speaker 1: a great emotional intensity that tells us

1604
01:38:07,037 --> 01:38:10,530
Speaker 1: this is very, very important.

1605
01:38:11,633 --> 01:38:15,946
Speaker 1: It's when we feel the weight of karma, in a

1606
01:38:15,966 --> 01:38:16,267
Speaker 1: way.

1607
01:38:17,209 --> 01:38:20,275
Speaker 6: Sorry no, sorry, continue the weight of

1608
01:38:20,315 --> 01:38:24,766
Speaker 6: karma that would compel us to act so would

1609
01:38:24,806 --> 01:38:27,092
Speaker 6: you then kind of say that the, the

1610
01:38:27,212 --> 01:38:30,747
Speaker 6: awakening of this aspect of our soul are,

1611
01:38:31,088 --> 01:38:33,392
Speaker 6: or this deepest part of ourself is, is

1612
01:38:33,452 --> 01:38:37,039
Speaker 6: literally one with kind of one's ability to

1613
01:38:37,145 --> 01:38:39,849
Speaker 6: recognize like importance and significance

1614
01:38:40,049 --> 01:38:41,911
Speaker 6: in a way that is extraordinarily deep and

1615
01:38:41,971 --> 01:38:42,252
Speaker 6: real?

1616
01:38:42,893 --> 01:38:45,276
Speaker 6: Real, like absolutely, that's like yeah

1617
01:38:45,296 --> 01:38:46,237
Speaker 6: okay, so it is.

1618
01:38:46,317 --> 01:38:51,189
Speaker 6: It's kind of like that awakening of, of, uh,

1619
01:38:51,290 --> 01:38:53,555
Speaker 6: the mind or our intelligence that just

1620
01:38:53,715 --> 01:38:58,646
Speaker 6: feels actual gravitas and importance, and

1621
01:38:58,806 --> 01:39:01,088
Speaker 6: and from that is where we, that sense of

1622
01:39:01,149 --> 01:39:04,772
Speaker 6: care emerges it's a sense of care, but

1623
01:39:04,792 --> 01:39:13,161
Speaker 6: there's a sense of um, of truth, and truth

1624
01:39:13,221 --> 01:39:13,762
Speaker 6: and rightness.

1625
01:39:16,149 --> 01:39:18,854
Speaker 1: In other words, if we, in other words, if

1626
01:39:18,874 --> 01:39:21,318
Speaker 1: we're not lying to ourself and we are, and

1627
01:39:21,338 --> 01:39:22,808
Speaker 1: we're daring to allow ourselves to be

1628
01:39:22,868 --> 01:39:23,630
Speaker 1: utterly vulnerable, transparent,

1629
01:39:23,651 --> 01:39:28,085
Speaker 1: transparent before our maker, then often we

1630
01:39:28,245 --> 01:39:29,590
Speaker 1: realize, in relationship to important

1631
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:30,774
Speaker 1: issues in life, that we really don't have

1632
01:39:30,814 --> 01:39:33,107
Speaker 1: any choices anymore.

1633
01:39:34,210 --> 01:39:37,701
Speaker 1: As we see, there's the next step of what's

1634
01:39:37,741 --> 01:39:38,584
Speaker 1: appropriate begins.

1635
01:39:38,644 --> 01:39:40,913
Speaker 1: As we've seen us being obvious, it's not

1636
01:39:41,134 --> 01:39:42,339
Speaker 1: even what we want anymore.

1637
01:39:42,379 --> 01:39:44,026
Speaker 1: It's about what needs to happen, what

1638
01:39:44,046 --> 01:39:46,313
Speaker 1: should happen, because of all the causes

1639
01:39:46,333 --> 01:39:47,878
Speaker 1: that have let it, let us up to that moment

1640
01:39:47,898 --> 01:39:49,704
Speaker 1: that we, that we can temporarily see very

1641
01:39:49,724 --> 01:39:54,732
Speaker 1: clearly then.

1642
01:39:55,033 --> 01:40:00,642
Speaker 6: So I guess the other uh uh aspect of this

1643
01:40:00,682 --> 01:40:02,505
Speaker 6: that I would love for you to maybe clarify,

1644
01:40:03,126 --> 01:40:05,772
Speaker 6: and how you experience it yourself and and

1645
01:40:05,792 --> 01:40:08,158
Speaker 6: how you're kind of conceptualizing this, is

1646
01:40:08,967 --> 01:40:10,671
Speaker 6: the you know there's.

1647
01:40:11,733 --> 01:40:13,898
Speaker 6: You know, obviously there's a way that we

1648
01:40:14,439 --> 01:40:17,566
Speaker 6: kind of, in our dualistic thinking, kind of

1649
01:40:17,606 --> 01:40:21,050
Speaker 6: compartmentalize aspects of ourselves and

1650
01:40:21,090 --> 01:40:22,291
Speaker 6: kind of objectify them.

1651
01:40:22,792 --> 01:40:26,076
Speaker 6: In a way, we um disconnect ourselves from

1652
01:40:26,436 --> 01:40:30,481
Speaker 6: realizing kind of our unity with right, so

1653
01:40:30,501 --> 01:40:33,131
Speaker 6: like the self is not just like a, an organ

1654
01:40:33,191 --> 01:40:37,081
Speaker 6: perhaps, but it's, it's a um, you know,

1655
01:40:37,141 --> 01:40:41,689
Speaker 6: when we're experiencing it's for lack of a

1656
01:40:41,729 --> 01:40:44,594
Speaker 6: better word like refuge in the soul, there

1657
01:40:44,634 --> 01:40:47,198
Speaker 6: is a unity with right, it's a kind of we

1658
01:40:47,258 --> 01:40:50,228
Speaker 6: are one with that soul, it's an aspect of

1659
01:40:50,649 --> 01:40:50,829
Speaker 6: me.

1660
01:40:50,890 --> 01:40:52,493
Speaker 6: It's not just, uh, something I'm

1661
01:40:52,613 --> 01:40:55,926
Speaker 6: intellectually kind of seeing as a

1662
01:40:55,966 --> 01:41:02,912
Speaker 6: particular organ of my um self right and um

1663
01:41:03,573 --> 01:41:10,139
Speaker 6: the so so it kind of, uh, I guess there's

1664
01:41:10,179 --> 01:41:15,669
Speaker 6: that sense of um, does the sorry, let me uh

1665
01:41:16,010 --> 01:41:25,475
Speaker 6: try to formulate my question here um, I

1666
01:41:25,515 --> 01:41:26,557
Speaker 6: guess there's this.

1667
01:41:27,138 --> 01:41:28,866
Speaker 6: You know, know, awakening to the hey, this

1668
01:41:28,926 --> 01:41:33,289
Speaker 6: is the deepest part of myself and from how

1669
01:41:33,329 --> 01:41:37,399
Speaker 6: you're saying, it's kind of it's where our

1670
01:41:37,439 --> 01:41:40,707
Speaker 6: sense of care and significance and

1671
01:41:40,748 --> 01:41:45,448
Speaker 6: importance ultimately would direct our, our

1672
01:41:45,588 --> 01:41:47,596
Speaker 6: choosing and our acting.

1673
01:41:48,525 --> 01:41:48,726
Speaker 1: Yes.

1674
01:41:50,125 --> 01:41:54,075
Speaker 6: So the still there's this kind of, in my

1675
01:41:54,176 --> 01:41:55,749
Speaker 6: mind at least, when I'm trying to

1676
01:41:55,789 --> 01:41:57,349
Speaker 6: conceptualize and understand this.

1677
01:41:58,085 --> 01:42:00,814
Speaker 6: Is it kind of in purifying my relationship

1678
01:42:02,645 --> 01:42:05,268
Speaker 6: to, let's say, the soul, recognizing more

1679
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:08,636
Speaker 6: deeply my unity with the soul, is it kind

1680
01:42:08,676 --> 01:42:08,736
Speaker 6: of?

1681
01:42:08,756 --> 01:42:11,410
Speaker 1: it's a, would you say it's also a revealing

1682
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:14,337
Speaker 1: that the soul is the actor, the soul is the

1683
01:42:14,397 --> 01:42:18,391
Speaker 1: chooser seeing that the choosing well, not

1684
01:42:18,471 --> 01:42:22,899
Speaker 1: always okay, so then so sometimes you can

1685
01:42:22,939 --> 01:42:24,247
Speaker 1: realize well that your soul could have

1686
01:42:24,287 --> 01:42:25,730
Speaker 1: revealed something to you that you didn't

1687
01:42:26,010 --> 01:42:27,875
Speaker 1: respond to because you weren't ready or you

1688
01:42:27,895 --> 01:42:28,416
Speaker 1: didn't want to.

1689
01:42:30,830 --> 01:42:33,108
Speaker 6: So I guess for me it's like it still begs.

1690
01:42:33,128 --> 01:42:37,095
Speaker 6: The question is like who is the doer, you

1691
01:42:37,136 --> 01:42:39,425
Speaker 6: know, or the actor, or the shooter?

1692
01:42:39,826 --> 01:42:40,610
Speaker 6: That's a long question.

1693
01:42:42,509 --> 01:42:43,986
Speaker 1: Well, we can go into this next time, but

1694
01:42:44,026 --> 01:42:45,571
Speaker 1: the doer is whoever's making the choices.

1695
01:42:47,567 --> 01:42:48,891
Speaker 1: Whichever part of yourself is making the

1696
01:42:48,911 --> 01:42:50,776
Speaker 1: choices, he's the one who's the doer.

1697
01:42:53,432 --> 01:42:54,956
Speaker 1: So, on a good, on a good day, it'll be the

1698
01:42:54,996 --> 01:43:00,989
Speaker 1: soul and a bad day, it'll be the ego I

1699
01:43:01,029 --> 01:43:02,671
Speaker 1: guess like it, but there's a.

1700
01:43:02,711 --> 01:43:04,712
Speaker 6: There's a there's the meta doer that's

1701
01:43:04,793 --> 01:43:05,834
Speaker 6: choosing between.

1702
01:43:05,854 --> 01:43:08,836
Speaker 1: But there's a there's a, there's the meta

1703
01:43:08,876 --> 01:43:10,398
Speaker 1: doer, that's choosing between those two.

1704
01:43:10,418 --> 01:43:11,339
Speaker 1: Would you say no, no, no, no, okay or is

1705
01:43:11,359 --> 01:43:11,999
Speaker 1: that just like?

1706
01:43:12,119 --> 01:43:13,861
Speaker 6: is that it's just an illusion of kind of

1707
01:43:14,141 --> 01:43:14,782
Speaker 6: conditioning?

1708
01:43:19,205 --> 01:43:19,486
Speaker 1: would you say.

1709
01:43:19,506 --> 01:43:21,052
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what you're referring to, but

1710
01:43:21,072 --> 01:43:22,498
Speaker 1: sometimes we make the right choices for the

1711
01:43:22,518 --> 01:43:22,880
Speaker 1: right reasons.

1712
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:23,864
Speaker 1: Sometimes we make the wrong choices for the

1713
01:43:23,884 --> 01:43:26,068
Speaker 1: wrong reasons and then sometimes we wake up,

1714
01:43:26,089 --> 01:43:28,376
Speaker 1: and still wake up a day later, a year later,

1715
01:43:29,145 --> 01:43:31,893
Speaker 1: a lifetime later, and say, oy vey, what did

1716
01:43:31,953 --> 01:43:32,194
Speaker 1: I do?

1717
01:43:33,798 --> 01:43:36,485
Speaker 1: Right and it's an advantage point of an

1718
01:43:36,545 --> 01:43:38,052
Speaker 1: awakened soul, awakened consciousness, we

1719
01:43:38,072 --> 01:43:40,342
Speaker 1: can see more clearly the forces that would

1720
01:43:40,423 --> 01:43:42,007
Speaker 1: work within us and why we made the choices

1721
01:43:42,027 --> 01:43:42,468
Speaker 1: that we did.

1722
01:43:44,792 --> 01:43:45,032
Speaker 6: Right.

1723
01:43:45,112 --> 01:43:47,576
Speaker 6: So I mean I, and I understand kind of the,

1724
01:43:47,957 --> 01:43:49,460
Speaker 6: of course, like the concept that our

1725
01:43:50,947 --> 01:43:55,975
Speaker 6: decisions can be, you know, uh, influenced

1726
01:43:56,075 --> 01:43:58,559
Speaker 6: by, let's say, like the voice of the ego

1727
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:01,427
Speaker 6: within us, right that fundamentally kind of

1728
01:44:01,648 --> 01:44:03,891
Speaker 6: overtakes or overrides or kind of colors

1729
01:44:04,812 --> 01:44:05,793
Speaker 6: that say the chooser.

1730
01:44:06,875 --> 01:44:10,600
Speaker 1: No, but again, it depends which voices are

1731
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:11,101
Speaker 1: we listening to.

1732
01:44:12,345 --> 01:44:12,566
Speaker 6: Right.

1733
01:44:12,806 --> 01:44:15,813
Speaker 6: So so just to say like, like, if we just

1734
01:44:15,893 --> 01:44:19,951
Speaker 6: use the polarity of the you know the, the

1735
01:44:20,031 --> 01:44:22,528
Speaker 6: soul versus, or the you know authentic self

1736
01:44:22,548 --> 01:44:24,909
Speaker 6: versus the ego, there's still, like the

1737
01:44:24,949 --> 01:44:27,095
Speaker 6: chooser that is picking between the two,

1738
01:44:27,905 --> 01:44:28,467
Speaker 6: would you right?

1739
01:44:28,948 --> 01:44:29,710
Speaker 6: Is that correct?

1740
01:44:30,613 --> 01:44:32,587
Speaker 1: But if you choose the authentic self, and

1741
01:44:32,607 --> 01:44:33,249
Speaker 1: that's the chooser.

1742
01:44:33,269 --> 01:44:34,393
Speaker 1: If you choose the ego, then that's the

1743
01:44:34,413 --> 01:44:34,734
Speaker 1: chooser.

1744
01:44:38,385 --> 01:44:38,626
Speaker 6: Okay.

1745
01:44:38,666 --> 01:44:43,616
Speaker 6: So you're just kind of saying then and you

1746
01:44:43,636 --> 01:44:44,979
Speaker 6: know, I'm just trying to work it out that

1747
01:44:45,386 --> 01:44:47,649
Speaker 6: that there's kind of like two choosers is

1748
01:44:47,669 --> 01:44:49,392
Speaker 6: like a meta chooser, and then there's a

1749
01:44:51,135 --> 01:44:53,179
Speaker 6: which is choosing between the choosers, or

1750
01:44:53,299 --> 01:44:54,597
Speaker 6: and then there's like but what?

1751
01:44:54,730 --> 01:44:57,205
Speaker 1: you were calling the meta chooser doesn't

1752
01:44:57,338 --> 01:44:57,991
Speaker 1: last long.

1753
01:44:58,123 --> 01:45:00,798
Speaker 1: The meta chooser becomes whichever part of

1754
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:03,811
Speaker 1: yourself made the choice to go one way or

1755
01:45:03,943 --> 01:45:04,595
Speaker 1: the other.

1756
01:45:04,728 --> 01:45:06,073
Speaker 5: That's the chooser, whichever part of

1757
01:45:06,093 --> 01:45:09,355
Speaker 5: yourself made it made the choice to go one

1758
01:45:09,375 --> 01:45:12,257
Speaker 5: way or the other, that because that that's

1759
01:45:12,598 --> 01:45:12,878
Speaker 5: the choosing.

1760
01:45:12,898 --> 01:45:17,221
Speaker 6: So the, um, I guess, like the, there's a

1761
01:45:17,261 --> 01:45:19,966
Speaker 6: way that you're saying hey, like when you

1762
01:45:20,106 --> 01:45:21,849
Speaker 6: like what you choose, you become.

1763
01:45:22,210 --> 01:45:25,517
Speaker 6: You're right, like the yes you're, man,

1764
01:45:25,557 --> 01:45:29,024
Speaker 6: you're, you are manifesting like the ego or

1765
01:45:29,144 --> 01:45:30,627
Speaker 6: the authentic self, or let's say like

1766
01:45:30,887 --> 01:45:34,273
Speaker 6: soul's care absolutely yes right.

1767
01:45:34,454 --> 01:45:37,559
Speaker 6: So I, I suppose, and maybe it's just

1768
01:45:37,625 --> 01:45:40,412
Speaker 6: something to to dive deeper into at another

1769
01:45:40,452 --> 01:45:41,736
Speaker 6: point, because it sounds like it's

1770
01:45:41,816 --> 01:45:45,456
Speaker 6: something to- takes more time to tease

1771
01:45:45,496 --> 01:45:46,540
Speaker 6: apart, but we should.

1772
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:47,262
Speaker 1: We should do that.

1773
01:45:47,363 --> 01:45:48,668
Speaker 1: But what I'm saying is what you're calling

1774
01:45:48,688 --> 01:45:51,199
Speaker 1: the meta chooser is not eternally present,

1775
01:45:51,319 --> 01:45:53,106
Speaker 1: it's not a constant not eternally present

1776
01:45:53,847 --> 01:45:57,192
Speaker 1: it's not okay, what?

1777
01:45:57,252 --> 01:46:00,077
Speaker 6: but if it's not eternally present, how is

1778
01:46:00,157 --> 01:46:03,007
Speaker 6: it then that, let's say, if I become the

1779
01:46:03,147 --> 01:46:04,589
Speaker 6: ego chooser, right?

1780
01:46:05,410 --> 01:46:07,454
Speaker 6: How is it that the ego chooser could ever

1781
01:46:07,514 --> 01:46:10,238
Speaker 6: then become the soul chooser?

1782
01:46:10,679 --> 01:46:11,880
Speaker 6: Do you see what I mean?

1783
01:46:12,025 --> 01:46:14,568
Speaker 1: It would be stuck, it's because there's

1784
01:46:14,588 --> 01:46:15,490
Speaker 1: still hope for your soul.

1785
01:46:16,573 --> 01:46:18,967
Speaker 1: But the thing is because, as long as

1786
01:46:18,987 --> 01:46:19,730
Speaker 1: there's still hope for your soul.

1787
01:46:19,750 --> 01:46:21,230
Speaker 1: But the point is, if you keep giving in to

1788
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:24,720
Speaker 1: the ego, and then that will start creating

1789
01:46:24,761 --> 01:46:26,187
Speaker 1: so much momentum that you won't be able to

1790
01:46:26,207 --> 01:46:28,373
Speaker 1: get out of it Because you and then that

1791
01:46:28,393 --> 01:46:29,276
Speaker 1: will start creating so much momentum that

1792
01:46:29,296 --> 01:46:30,519
Speaker 1: you won't be able to get out of it, because

1793
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:31,743
Speaker 1: you won't be able to even see the soul

1794
01:46:31,783 --> 01:46:32,425
Speaker 1: anymore in yourself.

1795
01:46:33,394 --> 01:46:34,525
Speaker 1: You won't be able to make that distinction

1796
01:46:34,605 --> 01:46:36,747
Speaker 1: because your soul, the world of the ego and

1797
01:46:36,787 --> 01:46:38,305
Speaker 1: its likes and dislikes and its preferences

1798
01:46:39,072 --> 01:46:41,088
Speaker 1: start becoming more and more real because

1799
01:46:41,108 --> 01:46:41,892
Speaker 1: you keep giving in to them.

1800
01:46:42,869 --> 01:46:45,489
Speaker 1: One keeps giving in to them, and then the

1801
01:46:45,529 --> 01:46:48,456
Speaker 1: whole world of the soul and its greater

1802
01:46:48,496 --> 01:46:49,338
Speaker 1: gravity sets us in depth.

1803
01:46:49,927 --> 01:46:53,720
Speaker 1: We begin to lose sight of it unless there's

1804
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:55,267
Speaker 1: some massive event in our life that

1805
01:46:55,288 --> 01:46:57,014
Speaker 1: reawakens us to it.

1806
01:46:58,309 --> 01:46:59,734
Speaker 1: If we keep choosing the ego, we can lose

1807
01:46:59,754 --> 01:47:01,452
Speaker 1: touch with our own souls, as many people do.

1808
01:47:02,207 --> 01:47:05,309
Speaker 1: And in the same way, if we start choosing

1809
01:47:05,349 --> 01:47:07,587
Speaker 1: for our souls and even the faces of the

1810
01:47:07,607 --> 01:47:09,229
Speaker 1: temptation to do otherwise, keep choosing

1811
01:47:09,309 --> 01:47:12,274
Speaker 1: it, then our awareness of the forces of the

1812
01:47:12,334 --> 01:47:14,176
Speaker 1: soul, depth of the soul, the gravitas of

1813
01:47:14,276 --> 01:47:15,678
Speaker 1: the soul becomes more and more available to

1814
01:47:15,738 --> 01:47:29,145
Speaker 1: us, more and more apparent to us like.

1815
01:47:29,165 --> 01:47:29,887
Speaker 6: There's like in my experience.

1816
