1
00:00:01,645 --> 00:00:03,650
Speaker 1: the context for these talks that I give are

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,252
Speaker 1: always the same.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,428
Speaker 1: It's always about how to introduce people

4
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:09,589
Speaker 1: to a completely different dimension of

5
00:00:09,649 --> 00:00:15,489
Speaker 1: reality, to introduce everybody to the

6
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:16,702
Speaker 1: nature of enlightenment, the nature of

7
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:17,606
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness.

8
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:23,465
Speaker 1: So I'm speaking in a particular context, to

9
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:24,949
Speaker 1: illuminate a particular dimension of

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,646
Speaker 1: reality, and I'm just offering one

11
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,490
Speaker 1: perspective and one maybe helpful way to

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,893
Speaker 1: think about something that's very difficult

13
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:32,554
Speaker 1: to understand.

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,444
Speaker 1: As Ken Wilber reminds us, he often says

15
00:00:40,464 --> 00:00:42,046
Speaker 1: that the map is not the territory.

16
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:48,355
Speaker 1: So in this talk, I'm going to try to give

17
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:52,167
Speaker 1: you a simple and fairly easy to understand

18
00:00:52,688 --> 00:00:56,305
Speaker 1: way to think about who you are, so you can

19
00:00:56,365 --> 00:00:57,749
Speaker 1: navigate between these different dimensions

20
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,965
Speaker 1: of yourself throughout the day and

21
00:00:59,985 --> 00:01:01,870
Speaker 1: hopefully learn how to make the right

22
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,271
Speaker 1: choices.

23
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:05,045
Speaker 1: Because when we're occupying parts of

24
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,548
Speaker 1: ourselves that aren't our best friends,

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,374
Speaker 1: it's often it's often a good time maybe not

26
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:11,703
Speaker 1: to talk and not to make any important life

27
00:01:11,784 --> 00:01:12,284
Speaker 1: decisions.

28
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,067
Speaker 1: That's kind of the idea.

29
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:20,024
Speaker 1: But uh, two weeks ago, one of my students

30
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,930
Speaker 1: asked me a question in this forum, in this

31
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:24,283
Speaker 1: context, and he said when I was talking

32
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:25,463
Speaker 1: about making choices, and he, and he asked

33
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,224
Speaker 1: me the question who this forum in this

34
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:26,372
Speaker 1: context?

35
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,060
Speaker 1: And he said when I was talking about making

36
00:01:27,047 --> 00:01:28,341
Speaker 1: choices and he asked me the question who's

37
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,749
Speaker 1: the one that's making the choices, who's

38
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:31,331
Speaker 1: the chooser?

39
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:33,985
Speaker 1: So it's in response to his question that

40
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:37,644
Speaker 1: I'm giving this talk tonight, or where I am

41
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,581
Speaker 1: this evening, about who the chooser is and

42
00:01:41,661 --> 00:01:47,488
Speaker 1: I want to give you a brief tour of the

43
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:49,072
Speaker 1: nature of what I'm going to call the four

44
00:01:49,132 --> 00:01:49,573
Speaker 1: selves.

45
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:53,286
Speaker 1: So hopefully in a way that will enable you

46
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:55,572
Speaker 1: to find these four selves inside your own

47
00:01:55,612 --> 00:01:59,149
Speaker 1: self and hopefully enable you to make to

48
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:02,118
Speaker 1: choose the self of the selves that you'd

49
00:02:02,138 --> 00:02:03,261
Speaker 1: like to be choosing and not to be

50
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:06,060
Speaker 1: victimized unconsciously by parts of

51
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,503
Speaker 1: yourself that you're not even aware of or

52
00:02:07,543 --> 00:02:08,465
Speaker 1: don't even understand.

53
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:13,561
Speaker 1: But once again, we're going to talk about

54
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:15,085
Speaker 1: the self and ego, structures and things

55
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,132
Speaker 1: like that, and there's so many ways we can

56
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:19,202
Speaker 1: talk about the human condition.

57
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:20,083
Speaker 1: It's so complex.

58
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:25,392
Speaker 1: So the model that I'm going to be using in

59
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,614
Speaker 1: this talk is very simple.

60
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:32,542
Speaker 1: It excludes so much of who we are, because

61
00:02:32,622 --> 00:02:34,323
Speaker 1: I'm not trying to give a comprehensive,

62
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:41,771
Speaker 1: multidimensional picture or map of all the

63
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,872
Speaker 1: dimensions of being human.

64
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:47,917
Speaker 1: I'm very specifically interested in

65
00:02:47,957 --> 00:02:49,785
Speaker 1: conveying the kind of information that I

66
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:52,647
Speaker 1: have found is necessary and important.

67
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,045
Speaker 1: That would enable us to make the right

68
00:02:56,085 --> 00:03:01,360
Speaker 1: choices if our heart and our soul is

69
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,810
Speaker 1: focused on actualizing our potential for

70
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,563
Speaker 1: waking into enlightened awareness or to

71
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,725
Speaker 1: become enlightened.

72
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,010
Speaker 1: So.

73
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:12,926
Speaker 1: So the way I'm going to be speaking about

74
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:16,468
Speaker 1: the four cells is specifically designed

75
00:03:16,508 --> 00:03:17,371
Speaker 1: with that in mind.

76
00:03:19,718 --> 00:03:21,223
Speaker 1: So what I'm going to do, I'm going to do.

77
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:22,621
Speaker 1: The definitions I'm giving you are not very

78
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:24,707
Speaker 1: complex, they're very simplistic, they're

79
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:27,824
Speaker 1: very easy to understand and they leave a

80
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:28,648
Speaker 1: lot out of the picture.

81
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:31,036
Speaker 1: But just to repeat, I'm leaving a lot out

82
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:33,071
Speaker 1: of the picture because I'm only interested

83
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,485
Speaker 1: in these talks and helping to convey one

84
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:39,621
Speaker 1: thing, which is how to see ourselves and

85
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:42,458
Speaker 1: how to relate to the human experience we're

86
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:46,236
Speaker 1: having if our heart's intention is to be

87
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:47,903
Speaker 1: spiritually liberated and to awaken to

88
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:48,707
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness.

89
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:55,347
Speaker 1: I'm not going to be speaking very much

90
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,361
Speaker 1: about the unconscious self, unconscious

91
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:01,266
Speaker 1: motivations, shadow and that kind of thing,

92
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:06,561
Speaker 1: because for the point I'm trying to make, I

93
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,222
Speaker 1: don't think it's necessary or important or

94
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:09,460
Speaker 1: necessarily even part of the journey.

95
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,772
Speaker 1: Very good, so.

96
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,073
Speaker 1: So a big part of the quest for

97
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,917
Speaker 1: enlightenment and awakening to enlightened

98
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:24,285
Speaker 1: awareness, a big part of that quest to

99
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:26,070
Speaker 1: speak in terms most of you have heard

100
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,329
Speaker 1: before is to find out who we are.

101
00:04:32,242 --> 00:04:33,467
Speaker 1: It's the search for the true self.

102
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:42,237
Speaker 1: And if we pay attention, if, through our

103
00:04:42,257 --> 00:04:44,383
Speaker 1: spiritual practice, we pay attention to the

104
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:48,793
Speaker 1: experience of being a self that we're

105
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:53,249
Speaker 1: having from one moment to another, we'll

106
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:57,304
Speaker 1: find that the self-feeling that we

107
00:04:57,365 --> 00:05:00,251
Speaker 1: experience from one moment to another tends

108
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:03,676
Speaker 1: to change for various reasons, in different

109
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:04,748
Speaker 1: circumstances and as a result of different

110
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,262
Speaker 1: kinds of stimulation tends to change for

111
00:05:05,194 --> 00:05:05,688
Speaker 1: various reasons, in different circumstances

112
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:06,549
Speaker 1: and, as results, different kinds of

113
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:07,230
Speaker 1: stimulation.

114
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:16,786
Speaker 1: So I think if we wanna become a conscious

115
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:18,705
Speaker 1: person which is a big part of what this is

116
00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:20,504
Speaker 1: all about we're aspiring to become a

117
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:23,005
Speaker 1: conscious person then it's important that

118
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:27,765
Speaker 1: we know who we are and which part of

119
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:31,012
Speaker 1: ourselves that we are relating to the world

120
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:33,287
Speaker 1: from in any given moment.

121
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:37,306
Speaker 1: Do you know which part of your own self you

122
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:40,604
Speaker 1: are relating to and identified with at this

123
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:41,026
Speaker 1: moment?

124
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:44,506
Speaker 1: Now, one of the things that I've noticed,

125
00:05:44,647 --> 00:05:47,652
Speaker 1: which is very interesting, very simple, but

126
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:49,566
Speaker 1: very interesting and very revealing and

127
00:05:49,586 --> 00:05:52,304
Speaker 1: very helpful, is that different parts of

128
00:05:52,364 --> 00:06:00,163
Speaker 1: our own self feel have unique kinds of

129
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:01,084
Speaker 1: emotional traits.

130
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:09,136
Speaker 1: So what do I mean by that?

131
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,203
Speaker 1: So I mean that the ego, which you have all

132
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:17,905
Speaker 1: heard about, probably far too much.

133
00:06:17,925 --> 00:06:20,272
Speaker 1: The ego feels like something particular,

134
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:21,014
Speaker 1: something specific.

135
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:26,090
Speaker 1: The ego feels like a particular kind of

136
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,752
Speaker 1: experience.

137
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:33,671
Speaker 1: The ego can feel really good once in a

138
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:33,932
Speaker 1: while.

139
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,965
Speaker 1: Or the ego can feel really bad and

140
00:06:36,045 --> 00:06:38,001
Speaker 1: absolutely terrible at other times, as I'm

141
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:39,126
Speaker 1: sure you all already know.

142
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:43,363
Speaker 1: So the ego and the way I want to speak

143
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,749
Speaker 1: about it today is not a singular

144
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:49,611
Speaker 1: proposition or a singular event or a

145
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:51,594
Speaker 1: singular kind of emotional and

146
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:53,716
Speaker 1: psychological and metaphysical experience.

147
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,446
Speaker 1: What the ego is changes from moment to

148
00:06:57,486 --> 00:06:59,792
Speaker 1: moment and feels differently from moment to

149
00:06:59,832 --> 00:07:00,132
Speaker 1: moment.

150
00:07:07,337 --> 00:07:08,280
Speaker 1: So what am I talking about?

151
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,047
Speaker 1: So the ego is the.

152
00:07:11,188 --> 00:07:12,458
Speaker 1: There's many ways we can speak about the

153
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:15,277
Speaker 1: ego, but the reason why, if we're speaking

154
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:16,483
Speaker 1: about enlightenment, we have to speak about

155
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:19,749
Speaker 1: the ego, because if we are speaking about

156
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:23,162
Speaker 1: enlightenment by any other, if we sorry if

157
00:07:23,182 --> 00:07:24,688
Speaker 1: we are speaking about enlightenment, then

158
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:26,920
Speaker 1: enlightenment is always about transcending

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,507
Speaker 1: the small self, transcending the ego.

160
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:31,246
Speaker 1: So, because enlightenment is about

161
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:32,963
Speaker 1: transcending the ego and that's what this

162
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:35,665
Speaker 1: talk is all about we have to define our

163
00:07:35,685 --> 00:07:36,107
Speaker 1: terms.

164
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:41,371
Speaker 1: So the ego, which is not your true self,

165
00:07:42,902 --> 00:07:44,548
Speaker 1: which is usually referred to as a separate

166
00:07:44,568 --> 00:07:49,923
Speaker 1: self, your true self, which is usually

167
00:07:49,943 --> 00:07:50,826
Speaker 1: referred to as a separate self, the ego we

168
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,711
Speaker 1: could call the self-organizing principle in

169
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:53,192
Speaker 1: the psyche.

170
00:07:56,021 --> 00:08:03,772
Speaker 1: And since we're defining ego in this moment

171
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,255
Speaker 1: as a self-organizing principle in the

172
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:09,381
Speaker 1: psyche, I think we would all agree that we

173
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,987
Speaker 1: would want our ego to be in good working

174
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:15,149
Speaker 1: order, to be healthy, to have a healthy ego,

175
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,249
Speaker 1: because if our ego is healthy and in good

176
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:23,263
Speaker 1: shape which is kind of unusual, but if the

177
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,060
Speaker 1: ego is healthy and in good shape, that

178
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,131
Speaker 1: means the self-organizing principle in the

179
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:32,008
Speaker 1: psyche, which creates a sense of coherence

180
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:35,641
Speaker 1: in the self, will be in good shape and that

181
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,821
Speaker 1: means we'll be mentally healthy, which is

182
00:08:40,364 --> 00:08:43,310
Speaker 1: something that we all hope we can attain.

183
00:08:44,913 --> 00:08:47,884
Speaker 1: Mental health it's getting more and more

184
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:49,109
Speaker 1: difficult these days, I know.

185
00:08:54,191 --> 00:08:54,332
Speaker 1: So.

186
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:55,958
Speaker 1: The ego is the self-organizing principle in

187
00:08:55,978 --> 00:09:02,750
Speaker 1: the psyche and the ego is the part of the

188
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:08,017
Speaker 1: self in which we feel our unique

189
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:08,859
Speaker 1: personality.

190
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:12,169
Speaker 1: Our unique persona coalesces and exists.

191
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,646
Speaker 1: It feels like to my ego.

192
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,251
Speaker 1: It feels very unique.

193
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:22,010
Speaker 1: I have a unique persona called Andrew Cohen,

194
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:27,607
Speaker 1: and that person's had a particular life

195
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:31,875
Speaker 1: story, life history which makes up a

196
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,748
Speaker 1: historical narrative that his ego

197
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:40,574
Speaker 1: identifies with.

198
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:54,524
Speaker 1: His history devise with is his story and my

199
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:54,726
Speaker 1: persona.

200
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:55,751
Speaker 1: My ego as a persona is having a certain

201
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:57,240
Speaker 1: life experience that existed once again in

202
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,046
Speaker 1: a particular now, as part of a particular

203
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:02,885
Speaker 1: narrative which is unique to me and most of

204
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:05,892
Speaker 1: us relate to the experience of body-mind,

205
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:10,807
Speaker 1: time-space through the narrative of this

206
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:20,487
Speaker 1: egoic persona and, generally speaking, the

207
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:27,427
Speaker 1: experience of the ego persona tends to be

208
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:34,004
Speaker 1: less than ecstatic, but it's possible for

209
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:38,473
Speaker 1: the ego to be in good working order,

210
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:40,084
Speaker 1: well-functioning, it's possible, that it

211
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:40,767
Speaker 1: can be healthy.

212
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,808
Speaker 1: Having a healthy ego means that we feel

213
00:10:44,888 --> 00:10:46,325
Speaker 1: good about ourselves, we have a healthy

214
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:48,360
Speaker 1: self-respect, we respect ourselves, we

215
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,908
Speaker 1: believe that we're good, decent, moral

216
00:10:53,872 --> 00:10:58,008
Speaker 1: beings, we're worthy of love and affection

217
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,172
Speaker 1: and kindness.

218
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:04,266
Speaker 1: And people who have strong egos, in the

219
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:05,790
Speaker 1: most positive sense of what it means to

220
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,566
Speaker 1: have a strong ego, tend to be accomplished

221
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:13,110
Speaker 1: men and women in different ways.

222
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:22,168
Speaker 1: So as part of this description, I'm trying

223
00:11:22,076 --> 00:11:23,143
Speaker 1: to describe what I would say is a healthy

224
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:23,253
Speaker 1: ego.

225
00:11:23,353 --> 00:11:24,275
Speaker 1: Part of this description is I'm trying to

226
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:27,100
Speaker 1: describe what I would say is a healthy ego.

227
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,761
Speaker 1: And if your ego is in good shape, it means

228
00:11:28,781 --> 00:11:30,147
Speaker 1: that you are, that you have.

229
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,569
Speaker 1: If you've endured heavy and intense

230
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:39,270
Speaker 1: traumatic events in your life, you have not

231
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,883
Speaker 1: been destroyed by them, your soul hasn't

232
00:11:40,903 --> 00:11:42,622
Speaker 1: been destroyed by them and you have.

233
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:45,329
Speaker 1: Either you've either survived or you've

234
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:45,851
Speaker 1: recovered.

235
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:50,408
Speaker 1: So enlightenment, and we wanna awaken to

236
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:51,121
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness.

237
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:58,010
Speaker 1: The ego's not necessarily a problem, but if

238
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:02,263
Speaker 1: our ego is unhappy, if our ego is unhappy,

239
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:07,381
Speaker 1: if our ego has been traumatized, brutalized,

240
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:13,012
Speaker 1: damaged, traumatized in a very profound way

241
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:18,165
Speaker 1: and it's not recovered, then that part of

242
00:12:18,185 --> 00:12:19,962
Speaker 1: the self, the small self, the ego, will be

243
00:12:20,142 --> 00:12:22,669
Speaker 1: pregnant with conscious and unconscious

244
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,080
Speaker 1: angers, anger, fear, resentment, pregnant

245
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,555
Speaker 1: with conscious and unconscious angers,

246
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:33,462
Speaker 1: anger, fear, resentment, existential

247
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:34,665
Speaker 1: confusion, fear, anxiety and things like

248
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:34,785
Speaker 1: that.

249
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:36,710
Speaker 1: We tend to make life, the experience of

250
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,886
Speaker 1: life and conscious life very torturous and

251
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:48,375
Speaker 1: unpleasant, difficult to navigate and to

252
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:48,996
Speaker 1: negotiate.

253
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,149
Speaker 1: And the unhappy ego, which has not

254
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:57,188
Speaker 1: recovered from its traumas and from its bad

255
00:12:57,228 --> 00:13:02,925
Speaker 1: experiences, experiences quite a lot of

256
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:04,590
Speaker 1: insecurity, fear and doubt.

257
00:13:08,446 --> 00:13:10,168
Speaker 1: Quite a lot of insecurity, fear and doubt.

258
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:12,992
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, there is an arm.

259
00:13:13,273 --> 00:13:14,835
Speaker 1: I see your camera on my upper left screen.

260
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,103
Speaker 1: It's going in and out and I find it

261
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:20,407
Speaker 1: distracting a little bit.

262
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:21,771
Speaker 1: If you could please adjust it so it remains

263
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:23,034
Speaker 1: in one position.

264
00:13:23,782 --> 00:13:24,425
Speaker 1: Thank you so much.

265
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,929
Speaker 1: Thank you so much, thank you very much.

266
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:31,333
Speaker 1: So the net, so what I'm describing now is

267
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,267
Speaker 1: the traumatized ego which is not recovered

268
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:43,225
Speaker 1: from trauma, and it tends to be where many

269
00:13:43,245 --> 00:13:44,249
Speaker 1: of our problems come from.

270
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:46,377
Speaker 1: The source or origin of a lot of our

271
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,644
Speaker 1: problems that we create for ourselves is

272
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:51,029
Speaker 1: often the reason that we tend to make bad

273
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:51,430
Speaker 1: choices.

274
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:56,828
Speaker 1: It's a place where we feel experience, fear,

275
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,569
Speaker 1: doubt, depression, anxiety, frustration,

276
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,887
Speaker 1: anger, resentment and all these things.

277
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:06,550
Speaker 1: So the negative ego is a drag.

278
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:09,947
Speaker 1: The negative ego is the worst part of me,

279
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,446
Speaker 1: is the worst part of each and every one of

280
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:11,607
Speaker 1: us.

281
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:21,317
Speaker 1: So in this way, I'd like you to be able to

282
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:27,672
Speaker 1: see that the ego is both our best friend

283
00:14:27,712 --> 00:14:28,594
Speaker 1: and our worst enemy.

284
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:33,487
Speaker 1: Now, the negative ego, because it's had

285
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:35,912
Speaker 1: such a hard time and has not yet recovered

286
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:38,541
Speaker 1: from that hard time, tends to have all

287
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:41,084
Speaker 1: kinds of egoic problems, like with

288
00:14:41,165 --> 00:14:45,710
Speaker 1: narcissism and self-identity.

289
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,876
Speaker 1: So the negative ego, the narcissistic ego,

290
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:56,285
Speaker 1: tends to need to always find a way to see

291
00:14:56,325 --> 00:14:58,106
Speaker 1: itself as being better than and superior to

292
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:58,587
Speaker 1: the others.

293
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:06,654
Speaker 1: So the negative ego, the narcissistic ego,

294
00:15:08,555 --> 00:15:10,097
Speaker 1: is often comparing itself to other people

295
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,582
Speaker 1: and is always interpreting its experience

296
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:25,884
Speaker 1: through this conscious or unconscious will

297
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:26,866
Speaker 1: or wish to be superior to and better than

298
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:27,828
Speaker 1: the other or the others.

299
00:15:27,868 --> 00:15:29,110
Speaker 1: And if you ever spend time with a person

300
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,633
Speaker 1: who always feels that they need to find a

301
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:38,945
Speaker 1: way to feel better than you are, it can

302
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:39,686
Speaker 1: make you feel uncomfortable.

303
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:40,788
Speaker 1: For obvious reasons and this is the part of

304
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:43,292
Speaker 1: the ego that we're seeking for

305
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:44,393
Speaker 1: enlightenment, or the awakening to

306
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:46,543
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness we have to learn how

307
00:15:46,564 --> 00:15:48,863
Speaker 1: to purify ourselves from it, liberate

308
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:51,166
Speaker 1: ourselves from it, make ourselves so

309
00:15:51,206 --> 00:16:00,077
Speaker 1: conscious of this unpleasant aspiration for

310
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:05,094
Speaker 1: superiority, because it's, it's very

311
00:16:05,155 --> 00:16:08,570
Speaker 1: destructive for our spiritual aspirations.

312
00:16:12,482 --> 00:16:13,486
Speaker 1: So this is a big subject.

313
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:16,043
Speaker 1: So now we're speaking about the ego as

314
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:18,644
Speaker 1: being positive, our best friend and our

315
00:16:18,684 --> 00:16:20,530
Speaker 1: source of very good feelings about ourself

316
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:23,169
Speaker 1: and about even life itself.

317
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:25,886
Speaker 1: We can feel from the positive ego, we can

318
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:29,743
Speaker 1: feel that life is good, it's good to be

319
00:16:29,784 --> 00:16:32,143
Speaker 1: alive and life is good, it's good to be

320
00:16:32,183 --> 00:16:36,863
Speaker 1: alive, and that life is good and it's a

321
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:38,589
Speaker 1: place of a source of appreciation and

322
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:39,050
Speaker 1: kindness.

323
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,048
Speaker 1: Also Because people have a lot of

324
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:43,960
Speaker 1: self-confidence and believe in themselves

325
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,128
Speaker 1: and realize their own inherent dignity and

326
00:16:46,148 --> 00:16:50,261
Speaker 1: decency, have a room inside their souls and

327
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:51,306
Speaker 1: their hearts for other people.

328
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:55,089
Speaker 1: They tend to be kinder and more generous

329
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:57,527
Speaker 1: people, whereas people who are very angry

330
00:16:57,567 --> 00:17:03,106
Speaker 1: and victimized and frustrated by life tend

331
00:17:03,126 --> 00:17:04,851
Speaker 1: to be obsessed with their own unhappiness.

332
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,447
Speaker 1: They tend to have less time for the

333
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:08,209
Speaker 1: wellbeing of others.

334
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:18,577
Speaker 1: So the positive ego feels good.

335
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,706
Speaker 1: The negative ego feels bad.

336
00:17:26,941 --> 00:17:29,168
Speaker 1: Now, if you pay attention to your

337
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,716
Speaker 1: experience, you tend to notice that one of

338
00:17:31,736 --> 00:17:33,624
Speaker 1: those moments when you're feeling good

339
00:17:35,268 --> 00:17:37,273
Speaker 1: about yourself, about your accomplishments,

340
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:49,143
Speaker 1: about your aspirations, that's coming from

341
00:17:49,163 --> 00:17:49,907
Speaker 1: the positive ego.

342
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:54,928
Speaker 1: You should pay attention throughout the day

343
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,285
Speaker 1: when you're having these kinds of feelings.

344
00:17:56,446 --> 00:17:57,188
Speaker 1: Where is it coming from?

345
00:17:58,401 --> 00:17:59,406
Speaker 1: Oh, that's my positive ego.

346
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,726
Speaker 1: What does the positive ego feel like?

347
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:01,926
Speaker 1: The positive ego feels good.

348
00:18:03,222 --> 00:18:04,005
Speaker 1: It feels good to be me.

349
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,146
Speaker 1: It feels good to be Andrew.

350
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,380
Speaker 1: It feels good to be Andrew.

351
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,547
Speaker 1: I no longer hate myself.

352
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:13,468
Speaker 1: I like myself.

353
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,125
Speaker 1: I feel it feels good to be me.

354
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,526
Speaker 1: In all my imperfection, it feels good to be

355
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:19,667
Speaker 1: me.

356
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,406
Speaker 1: Fundamentally, it feels good to be me.

357
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,764
Speaker 1: It's the positive ego.

358
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:46,009
Speaker 1: The negative ego feels depressed, lonely,

359
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:46,893
Speaker 1: alienated, isolated, fearful, paranoid,

360
00:18:46,913 --> 00:18:47,798
Speaker 1: doubtful, tempted by nihilistic thoughts,

361
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:48,300
Speaker 1: that kind of thing.

362
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,782
Speaker 1: So when you're not feeling good, when

363
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:53,169
Speaker 1: you're feeling depressed and lousy, pay

364
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:55,033
Speaker 1: attention to the source of the bad feelings

365
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:57,470
Speaker 1: and you'll notice that it's coming from a

366
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,008
Speaker 1: psychological self-structure that we're

367
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:02,033
Speaker 1: calling the negative ego.

368
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:05,133
Speaker 1: That is entertaining or seeing the human

369
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:06,241
Speaker 1: experience that you're having through

370
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:09,851
Speaker 1: particular structures of thinking,

371
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,027
Speaker 1: particular habit patterns and habitual

372
00:19:12,047 --> 00:19:12,889
Speaker 1: structures of thinking.

373
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,777
Speaker 1: It gives you very bad feelings that are

374
00:19:17,797 --> 00:19:19,886
Speaker 1: very familiar because they're very

375
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:20,428
Speaker 1: conditioned.

376
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:25,191
Speaker 1: And then, if you're good at paying

377
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,560
Speaker 1: attention to your own experience, if you're

378
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,304
Speaker 1: a good meditator, if you're a good

379
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:34,794
Speaker 1: self-observer, if you're inclined to really

380
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:38,084
Speaker 1: focus on what's happening as it's happening,

381
00:19:39,706 --> 00:19:42,090
Speaker 1: you'll begin to notice these habitual

382
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,975
Speaker 1: patterns in your emotional experience.

383
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,290
Speaker 1: You're gonna start to notice that you feel

384
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,326
Speaker 1: bad because of particular ways of thinking.

385
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,486
Speaker 1: Habitual patterns of negative thinking

386
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,209
Speaker 1: create negative emotional responses in

387
00:19:58,249 --> 00:19:58,650
Speaker 1: yourself.

388
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,446
Speaker 1: If you pay attention, you'll start to

389
00:20:01,486 --> 00:20:02,764
Speaker 1: notice that you're feeling bad because of

390
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,807
Speaker 1: the way you're thinking and what you're

391
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:04,802
Speaker 1: thinking about it and the way you're

392
00:20:04,822 --> 00:20:05,404
Speaker 1: thinking about it.

393
00:20:06,602 --> 00:20:08,396
Speaker 1: It's something that you or we are doing to

394
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,045
Speaker 1: ourselves because it's become a habit, a

395
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:11,069
Speaker 1: bad habit.

396
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:18,507
Speaker 1: In the same way, if you're feeling good

397
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:21,861
Speaker 1: about yourself, about your positive ego, it

398
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:23,225
Speaker 1: has to do with the way that you're thinking

399
00:20:23,245 --> 00:20:27,241
Speaker 1: about your own self, about you, the way, in

400
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:28,847
Speaker 1: my case, andrew's thinking about Andrew,

401
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,105
Speaker 1: the way I'm thinking about me.

402
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,689
Speaker 1: If I'm thinking in ways that are

403
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:41,950
Speaker 1: constructive and life affirming and

404
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,743
Speaker 1: inherently positive, I tend to feel good.

405
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:52,593
Speaker 1: So these different structures of ourself

406
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,715
Speaker 1: operate within us as habitual patterns of

407
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:04,722
Speaker 1: thinking, habitual tendencies to think in

408
00:21:04,742 --> 00:21:05,947
Speaker 1: predictable patterns that have predictable

409
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:06,609
Speaker 1: emotional results.

410
00:21:13,182 --> 00:21:17,162
Speaker 1: So usually, if you're feeling bad, it's

411
00:21:17,182 --> 00:21:20,125
Speaker 1: because you've been dwelling on the way

412
00:21:20,165 --> 00:21:21,710
Speaker 1: your negative ego feels about life.

413
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,825
Speaker 1: If you're feeling bad, it's because you're

414
00:21:24,756 --> 00:21:25,461
Speaker 1: dwelling on how your negative ego feels

415
00:21:25,392 --> 00:21:25,503
Speaker 1: about life.

416
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:26,299
Speaker 1: If you're feeling bad, it's because you're

417
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:27,412
Speaker 1: dwelling on how your negative ego feels

418
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,605
Speaker 1: about life Not a good thing to be doing.

419
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,102
Speaker 1: And if you're feeling good, it means you

420
00:21:35,223 --> 00:21:37,205
Speaker 1: are delighting in how your positive ego

421
00:21:37,225 --> 00:21:37,968
Speaker 1: feels about life.

422
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,565
Speaker 1: Now in the search for the awakening to

423
00:21:57,606 --> 00:21:58,309
Speaker 1: enlightenment and the awakening to

424
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,200
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness.

425
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:04,729
Speaker 1: There is a famous distinction made in

426
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,733
Speaker 1: Mahayana Buddhism.

427
00:22:07,782 --> 00:22:09,107
Speaker 1: It's called the two-truth doctrine.

428
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,806
Speaker 1: According to the two-truth doctrine tells

429
00:22:10,926 --> 00:22:13,987
Speaker 1: us that there is what's called relative

430
00:22:14,027 --> 00:22:15,591
Speaker 1: reality and absolute reality.

431
00:22:17,264 --> 00:22:20,084
Speaker 1: There's two fundamental distinctions in the

432
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,750
Speaker 1: experience of consciousness and cognition.

433
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,021
Speaker 1: One occurs in the relative context and the

434
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,628
Speaker 1: other occurs in the absolute context.

435
00:22:31,411 --> 00:22:33,061
Speaker 1: So the small self that we experience as

436
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:36,466
Speaker 1: positive ego or negative ego exists in the

437
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:37,470
Speaker 1: relative category.

438
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:41,900
Speaker 1: So, according to the two-truth doctrine and

439
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,950
Speaker 1: the way I've been describing the ego so far,

440
00:22:49,924 --> 00:22:51,928
Speaker 1: all the positive experiences and feelings

441
00:22:51,988 --> 00:22:54,232
Speaker 1: and thoughts of the positive ego are

442
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:58,202
Speaker 1: occurring in a relative context and all of

443
00:22:58,262 --> 00:23:00,087
Speaker 1: the negative thoughts and feelings of the

444
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:01,450
Speaker 1: negative ego are all occurring in a

445
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,372
Speaker 1: relative context.

446
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,129
Speaker 1: The negative ego are all occurring in a

447
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,469
Speaker 1: relative context.

448
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:10,512
Speaker 1: So when we wake up, when we have the

449
00:23:10,552 --> 00:23:16,449
Speaker 1: experience of spiritual awakening, when we

450
00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:19,912
Speaker 1: become conscious of consciousness, when we

451
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:22,242
Speaker 1: awaken to enlightened awareness, there's a

452
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:29,466
Speaker 1: shift from relative reality relative

453
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:30,569
Speaker 1: cognition to absolute reality and absolute

454
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:30,810
Speaker 1: cognition.

455
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,095
Speaker 1: The lights go on and suddenly we find we're

456
00:23:33,115 --> 00:23:35,800
Speaker 1: in a completely seeing reality from the

457
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:41,290
Speaker 1: perspective of a completely different

458
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:41,991
Speaker 1: dimension of knowing and of being.

459
00:23:42,011 --> 00:23:43,834
Speaker 1: So the enlightened awareness, the awareness

460
00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:45,878
Speaker 1: of enlightenment or the experience or the

461
00:23:45,898 --> 00:23:46,599
Speaker 1: presence of enlightened awareness.

462
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:51,851
Speaker 1: The awareness of enlightenment or the

463
00:23:51,871 --> 00:23:53,356
Speaker 1: experience or the presence of enlightened

464
00:23:53,376 --> 00:23:58,264
Speaker 1: awareness emerges or becomes apparent to us

465
00:23:58,284 --> 00:23:59,048
Speaker 1: when we make that flip from relative

466
00:23:59,068 --> 00:23:59,933
Speaker 1: reality to absolute reality, from relative

467
00:23:59,953 --> 00:24:01,601
Speaker 1: consciousness to absolute consciousness and

468
00:24:01,621 --> 00:24:03,247
Speaker 1: relative cognition to absolute cognition,

469
00:24:05,162 --> 00:24:06,066
Speaker 1: Like the lights go on.

470
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:18,675
Speaker 1: Now, in my experience, there are two

471
00:24:21,738 --> 00:24:28,364
Speaker 1: experiences of the self that we come upon

472
00:24:28,445 --> 00:24:30,251
Speaker 1: when lights go on, when we make that flip

473
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:32,139
Speaker 1: from relative reality to absolute reality,

474
00:24:32,983 --> 00:24:34,073
Speaker 1: from relative consciousness to absolute

475
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:34,646
Speaker 1: consciousness, relative reality to absolute

476
00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:35,119
Speaker 1: reality, from relative consciousness to

477
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:36,427
Speaker 1: absolute consciousness and relative

478
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:37,793
Speaker 1: cognition to absolute cognition.

479
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:45,495
Speaker 1: One is from the small self, which is the

480
00:24:45,596 --> 00:24:48,408
Speaker 1: ego, to the true self, which all of you

481
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:49,231
Speaker 1: have already heard about.

482
00:24:49,271 --> 00:25:11,945
Speaker 1: The true self, true self.

483
00:25:11,986 --> 00:25:13,428
Speaker 1: So the true self is the experience of being.

484
00:25:13,448 --> 00:25:16,513
Speaker 1: Being is the conscious knowing of the

485
00:25:16,574 --> 00:25:17,655
Speaker 1: deepest dimension of reality that exists

486
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:19,058
Speaker 1: before the universe had even arisen as a

487
00:25:19,078 --> 00:25:20,080
Speaker 1: thought in the mind of God.

488
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:25,174
Speaker 1: So being is that primordial ground from

489
00:25:25,214 --> 00:25:29,248
Speaker 1: which all of reality emerges, and the

490
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:31,895
Speaker 1: conscious gnosis of being, the conscious

491
00:25:31,955 --> 00:25:33,667
Speaker 1: experience of being, the conscious knowing

492
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:37,377
Speaker 1: of being, is the experience of peace.

493
00:25:39,946 --> 00:25:41,553
Speaker 1: Before the universe was created, there was

494
00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:45,155
Speaker 1: only peace, because before the universe was

495
00:25:45,196 --> 00:25:46,227
Speaker 1: created nothing had happened.

496
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:50,751
Speaker 1: Things can only go wrong after the Big Bang.

497
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:54,528
Speaker 1: Before the universe was created, everything

498
00:25:54,568 --> 00:25:59,531
Speaker 1: was quiet, peaceful, timeless and formless,

499
00:25:59,572 --> 00:26:00,799
Speaker 1: and beginningless and endless, because

500
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,206
Speaker 1: before the universe was created there was

501
00:26:02,246 --> 00:26:05,373
Speaker 1: no time and there was no space, there's no

502
00:26:05,474 --> 00:26:06,977
Speaker 1: universe and there certainly was no you and

503
00:26:06,997 --> 00:26:07,325
Speaker 1: no me.

504
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:10,953
Speaker 1: So when we awaken to the ground of all

505
00:26:11,013 --> 00:26:13,398
Speaker 1: being, which Eckhart Tolle describes so

506
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:14,316
Speaker 1: beautifully, the ground of all being, when

507
00:26:14,258 --> 00:26:14,498
Speaker 1: you and I awaken to the ground of all being,

508
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:14,929
Speaker 1: which Eckhart Tolle describes so

509
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:15,844
Speaker 1: beautifully, the ground of all being, when

510
00:26:15,864 --> 00:26:17,851
Speaker 1: you and I awaken to the ground of all being,

511
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:20,491
Speaker 1: to that deepest dimension of reality that

512
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:23,468
Speaker 1: exists prior to the emergence of time and

513
00:26:23,488 --> 00:26:26,556
Speaker 1: space, how do we know it?

514
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:29,488
Speaker 1: Because we suddenly experience at the level

515
00:26:29,508 --> 00:26:30,070
Speaker 1: of the self.

516
00:26:30,225 --> 00:26:32,854
Speaker 1: We experience overwhelming peace.

517
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:37,712
Speaker 1: An overwhelming peace, but it's a peace

518
00:26:37,732 --> 00:26:38,755
Speaker 1: without any boundaries.

519
00:26:40,586 --> 00:26:42,012
Speaker 1: It's a peace that exists everywhere and

520
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:42,393
Speaker 1: nowhere.

521
00:26:43,825 --> 00:26:45,631
Speaker 1: It's a peace that is timeless and formless,

522
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:48,106
Speaker 1: beginningless and endless, birthless and

523
00:26:48,146 --> 00:26:52,157
Speaker 1: deathless and infinite and eternal.

524
00:26:55,486 --> 00:26:57,091
Speaker 1: So when we make that leap from a, that leap

525
00:26:57,131 --> 00:26:58,805
Speaker 1: from the world of relative reality, where

526
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:06,593
Speaker 1: the ego dominates, and we awaken to the

527
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:09,589
Speaker 1: ground of eternity itself, it's quite a

528
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:10,954
Speaker 1: flip, it's quite a jump.

529
00:27:11,606 --> 00:27:14,213
Speaker 1: It's not a small change of consciousness

530
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:19,474
Speaker 1: and cognition, it's an absolute leap beyond

531
00:27:19,494 --> 00:27:21,070
Speaker 1: what the mind can even begin to imagine.

532
00:27:23,065 --> 00:27:26,686
Speaker 1: It's not a small, subtle shift, it's an

533
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:27,871
Speaker 1: absolute transformation.

534
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:33,631
Speaker 1: So the truth, what's generally called the

535
00:27:33,671 --> 00:27:42,408
Speaker 1: true self, feels like peace, and this is

536
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:43,397
Speaker 1: very important to understand this, because

537
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:45,329
Speaker 1: I'm trying to describe in this talk how the

538
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:47,215
Speaker 1: self feels, which means how I feel.

539
00:27:47,325 --> 00:27:48,450
Speaker 1: What does it feel like to be me?

540
00:27:51,108 --> 00:27:52,191
Speaker 1: The question is well, what does it feel

541
00:27:52,211 --> 00:27:53,195
Speaker 1: like to be you, andrew?

542
00:27:53,245 --> 00:27:53,880
Speaker 1: What does it feel like to be any one of us?

543
00:27:53,835 --> 00:27:54,564
Speaker 1: The question is well, what does it feel

544
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:54,720
Speaker 1: like to be you, andrew?

545
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:54,870
Speaker 1: What does it feel like to be any one of us?

546
00:27:54,985 --> 00:27:56,431
Speaker 1: The question is well, what does it feel

547
00:27:56,451 --> 00:27:56,973
Speaker 1: like to be me?

548
00:27:59,787 --> 00:28:01,012
Speaker 1: Which part of me are you referring to?

549
00:28:01,105 --> 00:28:02,630
Speaker 1: Are you referring to my positive ego, my

550
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,875
Speaker 1: negative ego, my true self?

551
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:06,351
Speaker 1: Because they all feel very different.

552
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:10,810
Speaker 1: So what's important to understand here is

553
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,108
Speaker 1: that the true self, which is the conscious

554
00:28:15,471 --> 00:28:19,626
Speaker 1: gnosis of the ground of all being, being,

555
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:21,651
Speaker 1: exists prior to anything and everything

556
00:28:21,752 --> 00:28:26,468
Speaker 1: else that we can imagine, exists prior to

557
00:28:26,508 --> 00:28:28,152
Speaker 1: time and space, prior to the emergence of

558
00:28:28,193 --> 00:28:29,957
Speaker 1: the evolving universe.

559
00:28:33,686 --> 00:28:35,211
Speaker 1: So, because the ground of being exists

560
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:39,556
Speaker 1: prior to all things, it's a place and a

561
00:28:39,596 --> 00:28:44,355
Speaker 1: space, a dimension and a reality in which

562
00:28:45,588 --> 00:28:46,631
Speaker 1: nothing has ever happened.

563
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:49,628
Speaker 1: Nothing has ever happened, nothing has ever

564
00:28:49,668 --> 00:28:49,990
Speaker 1: happened.

565
00:28:51,418 --> 00:28:53,729
Speaker 1: So in that mysterious dimension where

566
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:59,247
Speaker 1: nothing's ever happened, nothing is wrong,

567
00:29:00,851 --> 00:29:02,614
Speaker 1: nothing could be wrong, because nothing

568
00:29:03,015 --> 00:29:04,986
Speaker 1: could have gone wrong yet, because nothing

569
00:29:05,027 --> 00:29:05,528
Speaker 1: happened yet.

570
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:08,015
Speaker 1: So it's important to understand that the

571
00:29:08,055 --> 00:29:10,792
Speaker 1: conscious knows, as the conscious awakening

572
00:29:10,812 --> 00:29:12,476
Speaker 1: to the ground of all being, what's called

573
00:29:12,496 --> 00:29:13,008
Speaker 1: the ground of all being.

574
00:29:13,028 --> 00:29:13,994
Speaker 1: To repeat, it's their awakening to the

575
00:29:14,014 --> 00:29:15,102
Speaker 1: ground of all being, what's called the

576
00:29:15,122 --> 00:29:15,545
Speaker 1: ground of all being.

577
00:29:15,965 --> 00:29:16,836
Speaker 1: To repeat, it's their awakening to the

578
00:29:16,876 --> 00:29:18,756
Speaker 1: deepest dimension of reality that exists

579
00:29:18,776 --> 00:29:20,649
Speaker 1: prior to the emergence of time and space

580
00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:21,573
Speaker 1: and the whole universe.

581
00:29:22,985 --> 00:29:24,567
Speaker 1: So before time and space, before the

582
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:27,428
Speaker 1: universe came into being, there was only

583
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:27,790
Speaker 1: being.

584
00:29:28,686 --> 00:29:30,052
Speaker 1: There was no thing else.

585
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:37,137
Speaker 1: So being can be called nothingness,

586
00:29:37,197 --> 00:29:41,191
Speaker 1: emptiness, primordial emptiness, primordial

587
00:29:41,251 --> 00:29:42,693
Speaker 1: voidness, nothingness.

588
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,550
Speaker 1: But the flip here is going from relative

589
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:51,066
Speaker 1: consciousness and relative cognition,

590
00:29:52,028 --> 00:29:53,973
Speaker 1: relative knowing, the absolute

591
00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:55,516
Speaker 1: consciousness, absolute cognition and

592
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:56,218
Speaker 1: absolute knowing.

593
00:29:58,447 --> 00:30:03,329
Speaker 1: So it's a leap into eternity, the conscious

594
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,545
Speaker 1: gnosis, the conscious recognition, the

595
00:30:05,566 --> 00:30:07,333
Speaker 1: waking to eternity.

596
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:08,510
Speaker 1: What does eternity mean?

597
00:30:09,445 --> 00:30:11,612
Speaker 1: Eternity means timeless and formless,

598
00:30:12,565 --> 00:30:15,372
Speaker 1: beginningless and endless, birthless and

599
00:30:15,412 --> 00:30:23,692
Speaker 1: deathless, infinite and the true self.

600
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:26,986
Speaker 1: When you awaken to the true self, the true

601
00:30:27,006 --> 00:30:32,390
Speaker 1: self feels like you, but it's not the same

602
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:32,571
Speaker 1: you.

603
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:38,877
Speaker 1: This is you as liberated, emancipated,

604
00:30:41,525 --> 00:30:45,076
Speaker 1: eternal knowing, being, feeling.

605
00:30:47,326 --> 00:30:49,032
Speaker 1: So suddenly it feels very different to be

606
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:49,975
Speaker 1: any one of us.

607
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:54,289
Speaker 1: It feels very different to be Andrew and in

608
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,899
Speaker 1: that state of us it feels very different to

609
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:56,100
Speaker 1: be Andrew.

610
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,387
Speaker 1: And in that state of consciousness, and the

611
00:30:58,427 --> 00:31:00,405
Speaker 1: happy, the feelings of happiness and the

612
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:10,814
Speaker 1: happy ego become meaningless, because the

613
00:31:10,895 --> 00:31:12,886
Speaker 1: narrative of Andrew's story becomes

614
00:31:12,966 --> 00:31:14,288
Speaker 1: meaningless in that context.

615
00:31:16,692 --> 00:31:20,418
Speaker 1: And it is a great relief to put down the

616
00:31:20,438 --> 00:31:25,763
Speaker 1: burden of being Andrew, even the happy

617
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:25,964
Speaker 1: Andrew.

618
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:28,652
Speaker 1: It's a great burden, in that state of

619
00:31:28,672 --> 00:31:29,754
Speaker 1: consciousness, to put down all of his

620
00:31:29,774 --> 00:31:32,589
Speaker 1: suitcases and his belongings, to be free of

621
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:36,479
Speaker 1: all of it as belongings, to be free of all

622
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:45,473
Speaker 1: of it and to experience the unimaginable

623
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:47,917
Speaker 1: purity of never having been born and never

624
00:31:47,938 --> 00:31:49,140
Speaker 1: having entered the stream of time.

625
00:31:50,806 --> 00:31:57,185
Speaker 1: It's a place where there is no karma and

626
00:31:57,205 --> 00:31:58,570
Speaker 1: the experience of that kind of freedom is

627
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:02,584
Speaker 1: unimaginable to the ego, even to the

628
00:32:02,624 --> 00:32:03,266
Speaker 1: positive ego.

629
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:06,146
Speaker 1: It's unimaginable Because it's a different

630
00:32:06,246 --> 00:32:08,348
Speaker 1: order of human experience, it's a different

631
00:32:08,408 --> 00:32:10,631
Speaker 1: order of context.

632
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:30,900
Speaker 1: So so the positive ego feels good about

633
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,845
Speaker 1: itself and about life in a relative context.

634
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:36,113
Speaker 1: The negative ego feels bad about itself and

635
00:32:36,774 --> 00:32:39,705
Speaker 1: ambivalent about life, to say the least, in

636
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:40,827
Speaker 1: a relative context.

637
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:47,217
Speaker 1: But the true self experiences the ecstasy

638
00:32:47,277 --> 00:32:58,938
Speaker 1: of being or non-being in an absolute

639
00:32:59,018 --> 00:32:59,178
Speaker 1: context.

640
00:33:00,586 --> 00:33:03,297
Speaker 1: This is what some people call

641
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:06,327
Speaker 1: superconsciousness, and it becomes

642
00:33:06,348 --> 00:33:07,274
Speaker 1: superconsciousness versus relative

643
00:33:07,294 --> 00:33:08,200
Speaker 1: consciousness because in that leap it had

644
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,510
Speaker 1: flipped from relative or relative context

645
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,534
Speaker 1: to an absolute context.

646
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:18,377
Speaker 1: But the true self feels very particular.

647
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:24,952
Speaker 1: When someone awakens to their true self,

648
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:31,449
Speaker 1: you can see a particular look, they start

649
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,353
Speaker 1: to look a particular way.

650
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:39,325
Speaker 1: Their eyes, the look in their eye, changes,

651
00:33:40,005 --> 00:33:40,817
Speaker 1: they calm down and they slow down and

652
00:33:40,838 --> 00:33:42,931
Speaker 1: they're seeing you from a space and a place

653
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:45,432
Speaker 1: of infinite depth that can't be measured.

654
00:33:46,906 --> 00:33:50,049
Speaker 1: And in that state of consciousness all of

655
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:51,875
Speaker 1: the fears and concerns of the small self

656
00:33:53,108 --> 00:33:54,031
Speaker 1: are nowhere to be found.

657
00:33:55,094 --> 00:33:58,850
Speaker 1: They don't exist Because, remember, in the

658
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,775
Speaker 1: context of the true self nothing has ever

659
00:34:00,815 --> 00:34:01,156
Speaker 1: happened.

660
00:34:04,606 --> 00:34:08,375
Speaker 1: So because nothing has ever happened, one

661
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:09,257
Speaker 1: is uncorrupted.

662
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:13,108
Speaker 1: In that state it's before the corruption

663
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:15,113
Speaker 1: and the damage has happened.

664
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:20,785
Speaker 1: And that's when we all become very

665
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:21,667
Speaker 1: delightful people.

666
00:34:26,054 --> 00:34:28,598
Speaker 1: The best people to hang out with, the best

667
00:34:28,638 --> 00:34:30,046
Speaker 1: people to hang out with and spend time with

668
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:31,229
Speaker 1: are those people who are awake to their

669
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:31,710
Speaker 1: true self.

670
00:34:36,905 --> 00:34:37,740
Speaker 1: Because when you make that flip from

671
00:34:37,781 --> 00:34:43,515
Speaker 1: relative to absolute consciousness, you

672
00:34:43,535 --> 00:34:46,851
Speaker 1: become utterly absorbed in how

673
00:34:48,241 --> 00:34:50,091
Speaker 1: extraordinary it is to be conscious of

674
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:50,653
Speaker 1: consciousness.

675
00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:55,195
Speaker 1: That in itself is a completely.

676
00:34:55,406 --> 00:34:57,492
Speaker 1: It's an overwhelming experience and it's an

677
00:34:57,593 --> 00:35:02,212
Speaker 1: overwhelming recognition in which all of

678
00:35:02,252 --> 00:35:07,327
Speaker 1: your relative needs seem to disappear I

679
00:35:07,427 --> 00:35:09,485
Speaker 1: need to do this and I need to do that, and

680
00:35:09,499 --> 00:35:10,963
Speaker 1: I have to have this and I have to have that

681
00:35:10,977 --> 00:35:12,381
Speaker 1: All gone, and I have to have this and I

682
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:21,167
Speaker 1: have to have that All gone and that state,

683
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:21,970
Speaker 1: consciousness to consciousness itself,

684
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,933
Speaker 1: becomes its own delight.

685
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:29,152
Speaker 1: So that's a flip from relative to absolute.

686
00:35:29,272 --> 00:35:35,496
Speaker 1: So I was talking about the ego, the happy

687
00:35:35,556 --> 00:35:37,179
Speaker 1: ego, the unhappy ego and the true self.

688
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:41,694
Speaker 1: There's one more, which I like to call the

689
00:35:41,735 --> 00:35:42,396
Speaker 1: authentic self.

690
00:35:46,106 --> 00:35:53,504
Speaker 1: So the authentic self is the experience of

691
00:35:53,544 --> 00:35:55,469
Speaker 1: liberation, liberated consciousness, that

692
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:59,972
Speaker 1: we find when we enter into what's called

693
00:36:00,173 --> 00:36:04,894
Speaker 1: flow states, whether we're skiing or

694
00:36:04,934 --> 00:36:08,108
Speaker 1: playing a musical instrument, making love,

695
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:15,413
Speaker 1: reading poetry or simply out for a walk in

696
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:15,754
Speaker 1: nature.

697
00:36:15,845 --> 00:36:19,535
Speaker 1: But when we enter into a sublime state of

698
00:36:19,996 --> 00:36:24,455
Speaker 1: flow, we suddenly become aware of the

699
00:36:26,744 --> 00:36:31,273
Speaker 1: movement of the cosmos within us and all

700
00:36:31,313 --> 00:36:31,794
Speaker 1: around us.

701
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,623
Speaker 1: So the source of this flow state within us

702
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:38,548
Speaker 1: and all around us, so the source of this

703
00:36:38,588 --> 00:36:42,641
Speaker 1: flow state, in my thinking, is the.

704
00:36:43,407 --> 00:36:44,873
Speaker 1: We call it the evolutionary impulse.

705
00:36:47,507 --> 00:36:49,445
Speaker 1: It's the conscious recognition, the

706
00:36:49,465 --> 00:36:51,212
Speaker 1: conscious awakening to and the cognizance

707
00:36:51,373 --> 00:36:54,053
Speaker 1: of the energy and intelligence that created

708
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:59,071
Speaker 1: the universe, that creative evolutionary

709
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:01,830
Speaker 1: spark that compelled the universe into

710
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:07,754
Speaker 1: being, it's the urge towards creativity,

711
00:37:08,045 --> 00:37:12,110
Speaker 1: it's that which compels us to be creative

712
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:12,931
Speaker 1: and to create.

713
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:31,578
Speaker 1: When any one of us awakens to our own

714
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:37,846
Speaker 1: unique gifts of creative gifts, our gifts

715
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:46,417
Speaker 1: to give rise to as yet unmanifest

716
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,390
Speaker 1: possibilities, when those new potentials

717
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:54,426
Speaker 1: start manifesting through us, whether it

718
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:55,971
Speaker 1: doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what the

719
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:57,956
Speaker 1: context is it could be science or music,

720
00:37:59,545 --> 00:38:07,247
Speaker 1: medicine or, as I said before, poetry we

721
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:08,973
Speaker 1: become one with the dance of the universe.

722
00:38:11,366 --> 00:38:15,446
Speaker 1: We become aware that the whole universe, in

723
00:38:15,348 --> 00:38:16,022
Speaker 1: that state of consciousness, we become

724
00:38:15,924 --> 00:38:16,403
Speaker 1: aware of the fact that the whole universe,

725
00:38:16,305 --> 00:38:17,623
Speaker 1: in that state of consciousness, we become

726
00:38:17,525 --> 00:38:17,663
Speaker 1: aware of the fact that the whole universe,

727
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,941
Speaker 1: from the perspective of that state of

728
00:38:19,962 --> 00:38:22,172
Speaker 1: consciousness, the whole universe, is one

729
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:25,045
Speaker 1: evolving self-aware being.

730
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,691
Speaker 1: The universe is a conscious, self-aware

731
00:38:26,752 --> 00:38:27,073
Speaker 1: being.

732
00:38:29,437 --> 00:38:31,125
Speaker 1: The universe, which is a self-aware being,

733
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:33,428
Speaker 1: is not a static being but is a being.

734
00:38:33,448 --> 00:38:35,982
Speaker 1: Thataware being is not a static being but

735
00:38:36,103 --> 00:38:37,450
Speaker 1: is in a being that is part of a development,

736
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,421
Speaker 1: that is part of a developmental process,

737
00:38:39,481 --> 00:38:41,671
Speaker 1: that is a developmental process in progress.

738
00:38:43,726 --> 00:38:44,548
Speaker 1: And when you're in that state of

739
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:46,273
Speaker 1: consciousness, you can see and you can feel

740
00:38:50,144 --> 00:38:55,266
Speaker 1: the ecstatic urgency of becoming, the

741
00:38:55,286 --> 00:38:57,052
Speaker 1: becoming of the cosmos, the becoming of the

742
00:38:57,133 --> 00:39:00,712
Speaker 1: universe, becoming more of who and what it

743
00:39:00,773 --> 00:39:02,036
Speaker 1: can be through you and through me.

744
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:05,951
Speaker 1: I am and you are the energy and

745
00:39:05,991 --> 00:39:07,335
Speaker 1: intelligence that created the universe,

746
00:39:07,985 --> 00:39:09,390
Speaker 1: awakening to itself through the body, mind

747
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:14,336
Speaker 1: and personality of myself or yourself.

748
00:39:15,593 --> 00:39:16,498
Speaker 1: This is when the universe becomes

749
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:17,344
Speaker 1: self-aware and personality of myself or

750
00:39:17,364 --> 00:39:21,938
Speaker 1: yourself, this is when the universe becomes

751
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:22,359
Speaker 1: self-aware.

752
00:39:22,885 --> 00:39:25,272
Speaker 1: So the universe becomes self-aware through

753
00:39:25,292 --> 00:39:26,315
Speaker 1: us, through the expanded state of

754
00:39:26,355 --> 00:39:27,989
Speaker 1: consciousness in which we become aware of

755
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:34,471
Speaker 1: this movement towards greater complexity,

756
00:39:35,585 --> 00:39:37,345
Speaker 1: the movement towards higher and higher and

757
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:39,312
Speaker 1: more complex possibilities of what's called

758
00:39:39,353 --> 00:39:39,874
Speaker 1: emergence.

759
00:39:47,026 --> 00:39:48,873
Speaker 1: So when we become aware in this way of the

760
00:39:48,973 --> 00:39:53,447
Speaker 1: universe becoming self-aware through us, of

761
00:39:53,507 --> 00:40:01,814
Speaker 1: its own dynamic creativity, there is the

762
00:40:02,117 --> 00:40:04,039
Speaker 1: thrilling recognition that we are part and

763
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:07,589
Speaker 1: parcel of a cosmic process that had a

764
00:40:07,629 --> 00:40:08,312
Speaker 1: beginning in time.

765
00:40:08,345 --> 00:40:09,791
Speaker 1: That's definitely going somewhere new.

766
00:40:10,986 --> 00:40:12,370
Speaker 1: It's on the infinite journey of

767
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,636
Speaker 1: self-becoming, of self-creating.

768
00:40:15,965 --> 00:40:19,674
Speaker 1: And when highly sophisticated self-aware

769
00:40:19,694 --> 00:40:22,025
Speaker 1: human beings awaken in this way, the

770
00:40:22,065 --> 00:40:23,672
Speaker 1: universe becomes conscious of itself

771
00:40:23,692 --> 00:40:24,153
Speaker 1: through them.

772
00:40:26,928 --> 00:40:28,353
Speaker 1: And that's when there's the awakening to

773
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:33,505
Speaker 1: evolutionary non-duality.

774
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:40,086
Speaker 1: Evolutionary non-duality, that's when we

775
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:40,447
Speaker 1: realize that I am.

776
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:41,732
Speaker 1: That means I am the energy and intelligence

777
00:40:41,752 --> 00:40:43,727
Speaker 1: that created the universe, awakening to

778
00:40:43,787 --> 00:40:45,293
Speaker 1: itself through the body-mind personality of

779
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:45,794
Speaker 1: myself.

780
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:52,052
Speaker 1: I am the universe becoming conscious of

781
00:40:52,072 --> 00:40:55,830
Speaker 1: itself through me, and that's a pretty big

782
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:56,271
Speaker 1: recognition.

783
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:57,497
Speaker 1: And that's a pretty big recognition.

784
00:40:57,517 --> 00:40:59,405
Speaker 1: It's a pretty big recognition.

785
00:41:00,086 --> 00:41:01,371
Speaker 1: And this kind of recognition, this kind of

786
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:03,429
Speaker 1: state of consciousness, this kind of

787
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:07,626
Speaker 1: knowledge, this is called the awakening to

788
00:41:07,646 --> 00:41:08,851
Speaker 1: what I call the authentic self.

789
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:12,393
Speaker 1: The awakening to the true self is very,

790
00:41:12,453 --> 00:41:13,156
Speaker 1: very different.

791
00:41:14,285 --> 00:41:15,528
Speaker 1: The awakening to the true self is.

792
00:41:15,568 --> 00:41:16,972
Speaker 1: The awakening to the true self is very,

793
00:41:16,992 --> 00:41:17,453
Speaker 1: very different.

794
00:41:17,473 --> 00:41:18,435
Speaker 1: The awakening to the true self is the

795
00:41:18,455 --> 00:41:20,340
Speaker 1: awakening to static, eternal being.

796
00:41:22,406 --> 00:41:23,672
Speaker 1: Being isn't going anywhere.

797
00:41:24,467 --> 00:41:25,644
Speaker 1: It is not a journey of becoming.

798
00:41:26,186 --> 00:41:31,698
Speaker 1: Being simply is eternally itself.

799
00:41:34,468 --> 00:41:39,968
Speaker 1: Being is static knowing, but in being there

800
00:41:40,028 --> 00:41:40,812
Speaker 1: is no becoming.

801
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:50,665
Speaker 1: So being is eternity consciousness, an

802
00:41:50,637 --> 00:41:52,208
Speaker 1: experience of eternity consciousness that

803
00:41:52,181 --> 00:41:53,556
Speaker 1: is static, and experience of eternity

804
00:41:53,576 --> 00:41:59,108
Speaker 1: consciousness that is static, that's the

805
00:41:59,148 --> 00:41:59,550
Speaker 1: true self.

806
00:41:59,645 --> 00:42:00,966
Speaker 1: The awakening to the authentic self is the

807
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:04,946
Speaker 1: awakening to the evolutionary impulse, the

808
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:10,775
Speaker 1: ecstatic urgency that gave rise to the

809
00:42:11,176 --> 00:42:12,178
Speaker 1: entire creative process.

810
00:42:15,007 --> 00:42:16,312
Speaker 1: That's an explosion in motion.

811
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:20,378
Speaker 1: So we're all part and parcel of an

812
00:42:20,418 --> 00:42:21,205
Speaker 1: explosion in motion.

813
00:42:21,265 --> 00:42:22,851
Speaker 1: When you become conscious of the explosion

814
00:42:22,892 --> 00:42:24,168
Speaker 1: in motion, you realize you are that

815
00:42:24,188 --> 00:42:25,032
Speaker 1: explosion in motion.

816
00:42:28,026 --> 00:42:29,587
Speaker 1: Then you realize something else, which is

817
00:42:29,607 --> 00:42:31,668
Speaker 1: that the explosion in motion needs your own

818
00:42:31,688 --> 00:42:32,672
Speaker 1: conscious participation in it in order for

819
00:42:32,692 --> 00:42:34,097
Speaker 1: the explosion in motion needs your own

820
00:42:34,138 --> 00:42:37,469
Speaker 1: conscious participation in it, in order for

821
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:38,934
Speaker 1: the explosion in motion to continue to

822
00:42:38,994 --> 00:42:41,809
Speaker 1: expand and on its own journey of

823
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:46,748
Speaker 1: complexification, we get to see how your

824
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:51,066
Speaker 1: own presence here in the universe is not

825
00:42:51,307 --> 00:42:52,933
Speaker 1: arbitrary, as some would like to believe,

826
00:42:54,345 --> 00:42:56,694
Speaker 1: but it's inherently purposeful.

827
00:43:00,288 --> 00:43:01,518
Speaker 1: And when you awaken to the fact that your

828
00:43:01,558 --> 00:43:03,028
Speaker 1: presence here in the universe is inherently

829
00:43:03,068 --> 00:43:06,992
Speaker 1: purposeful, this is liberating indeed, and

830
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:10,491
Speaker 1: so spiritually empowering, so profoundly

831
00:43:10,531 --> 00:43:11,435
Speaker 1: spiritually empowering.

832
00:43:13,668 --> 00:43:14,838
Speaker 1: So what does the authentic self feel like?

833
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:15,685
Speaker 1: What does the authentic self feel like?

834
00:43:15,745 --> 00:43:17,211
Speaker 1: What does your authentic self feel like?

835
00:43:17,946 --> 00:43:20,954
Speaker 1: Turned on, excited and big time inspired,

836
00:43:21,014 --> 00:43:22,017
Speaker 1: inspired, inspired.

837
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:24,812
Speaker 1: When you're awake to your authentic self,

838
00:43:24,905 --> 00:43:28,032
Speaker 1: you are burning with evolutionary

839
00:43:28,132 --> 00:43:31,567
Speaker 1: inspiration, evolutionary conviction and

840
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:32,692
Speaker 1: evolutionary commitment.

841
00:43:35,307 --> 00:43:36,592
Speaker 1: You know who you are and you know why

842
00:43:36,612 --> 00:43:38,970
Speaker 1: you're here and you're committed.

843
00:43:39,712 --> 00:43:41,670
Speaker 1: You're committed, you're committed for the

844
00:43:41,731 --> 00:43:42,313
Speaker 1: long haul.

845
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:46,953
Speaker 1: And if we look at the meaning of the long

846
00:43:46,993 --> 00:43:52,867
Speaker 1: haul in an evolutionary framework, long

847
00:43:52,907 --> 00:43:57,552
Speaker 1: haul it could mean forever, if not forever

848
00:43:57,592 --> 00:43:59,214
Speaker 1: for a very long time, but it might as well

849
00:43:59,234 --> 00:43:59,714
Speaker 1: be forever.

850
00:44:00,395 --> 00:44:01,296
Speaker 1: It means you're committed.

851
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:05,040
Speaker 1: I'm here, baby, I'm fully here.

852
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,602
Speaker 1: I'm here for the long haul.

853
00:44:08,638 --> 00:44:11,902
Speaker 1: Now that I'm awakened to who I really am, I

854
00:44:11,922 --> 00:44:17,621
Speaker 1: realize how much I'm awakened to who I

855
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:18,183
Speaker 1: really am.

856
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:19,526
Speaker 1: I realize how much I'm needed and that the

857
00:44:19,547 --> 00:44:20,350
Speaker 1: emergence of life and eventually the

858
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:22,609
Speaker 1: emergence of conscious life has not been a

859
00:44:22,689 --> 00:44:24,395
Speaker 1: random accident at all.

860
00:44:31,008 --> 00:44:34,174
Speaker 1: This was inevitably, this was inevitable

861
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,605
Speaker 1: and predetermined from the very beginning.

862
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,334
Speaker 1: When you become conscious of all the things

863
00:44:40,374 --> 00:44:43,179
Speaker 1: I'm describing, that becomes obvious.

864
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:48,430
Speaker 1: Consciousness in the capacity of

865
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,095
Speaker 1: consciousness is far from an accident.

866
00:44:50,976 --> 00:44:52,418
Speaker 1: It's a driver of the whole process.

867
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,028
Speaker 1: An accident, so drive over the whole

868
00:44:55,069 --> 00:44:55,311
Speaker 1: process.

869
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:56,905
Speaker 1: But for the consciousness of consciousness

870
00:44:57,608 --> 00:45:01,469
Speaker 1: to mean something, you, whoever you are,

871
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:06,045
Speaker 1: and me, whoever I am, when we awaken we

872
00:45:06,065 --> 00:45:08,334
Speaker 1: have to be ready to say yes and to respond

873
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:11,305
Speaker 1: to what we're realizing and to be committed

874
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:13,873
Speaker 1: to the evolution of the interior of the

875
00:45:13,893 --> 00:45:14,596
Speaker 1: whole cosmos.

876
00:45:16,286 --> 00:45:17,669
Speaker 1: And I hope you can see, when I'm speaking

877
00:45:17,709 --> 00:45:20,214
Speaker 1: this way, that this leap from relative

878
00:45:20,275 --> 00:45:22,545
Speaker 1: consciousness, relative cognition, to

879
00:45:22,645 --> 00:45:24,008
Speaker 1: absolute consciousness and absolute

880
00:45:24,028 --> 00:45:26,674
Speaker 1: cognition is the most radical flip of

881
00:45:26,714 --> 00:45:28,638
Speaker 1: context and perspective imaginable.

882
00:45:30,787 --> 00:45:32,591
Speaker 1: And if you are spiritually evolved enough

883
00:45:32,611 --> 00:45:34,314
Speaker 1: to be able to say yes and to surrender, at

884
00:45:34,334 --> 00:45:36,799
Speaker 1: that point and you're off to the races.

885
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:40,534
Speaker 1: Your feet have landed on the yonder shore

886
00:45:41,188 --> 00:45:43,543
Speaker 1: and now you become a co-creator of the

887
00:45:43,563 --> 00:45:45,911
Speaker 1: cosmos with the energy and intelligence

888
00:45:45,931 --> 00:45:47,356
Speaker 1: that gave rise to it in the first place,

889
00:45:49,973 --> 00:45:50,836
Speaker 1: which is you anyway.

890
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,673
Speaker 1: So four selves, getting back to the main

891
00:45:55,713 --> 00:45:57,096
Speaker 1: topic of this talk.

892
00:45:59,745 --> 00:46:01,230
Speaker 1: So there's the happy ego and the unhappy

893
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:05,694
Speaker 1: ego, the true self and the authentic self.

894
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:17,310
Speaker 1: The happy ego feels good about itself and

895
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:19,493
Speaker 1: positive about life in a relative context.

896
00:46:22,743 --> 00:46:26,569
Speaker 1: The negative ego feels bad about itself and

897
00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:28,472
Speaker 1: bad about life in a relative context.

898
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,806
Speaker 1: The true self experiences unconditional,

899
00:46:33,906 --> 00:46:37,814
Speaker 1: absolute freedom in an absolute context.

900
00:46:40,902 --> 00:46:46,248
Speaker 1: And the authentic self experiences ecstatic,

901
00:46:46,268 --> 00:46:48,493
Speaker 1: creative urgency in an absolute context.

902
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:55,708
Speaker 1: Now, these four cells that I'm describing,

903
00:46:57,491 --> 00:46:59,274
Speaker 1: you all will be able to locate in your own

904
00:46:59,314 --> 00:47:00,135
Speaker 1: self-experience.

905
00:47:04,461 --> 00:47:05,924
Speaker 1: I'm sure the first two, but I'm sure the

906
00:47:05,944 --> 00:47:07,587
Speaker 1: happy ego and the unhappy ego, are more

907
00:47:07,627 --> 00:47:10,333
Speaker 1: available to all of you than the other two,

908
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,965
Speaker 1: the two but as your spiritual practice

909
00:47:18,985 --> 00:47:19,888
Speaker 1: deepens and as your experience of higher

910
00:47:19,908 --> 00:47:20,931
Speaker 1: consciousness develops, you begin to become

911
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:21,894
Speaker 1: familiar with the true self.

912
00:47:21,955 --> 00:47:23,980
Speaker 1: I'm speaking about the authentic self I'm

913
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:31,390
Speaker 1: speaking about, and so the happy ego and

914
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:35,676
Speaker 1: the positive ego feels very specific, very

915
00:47:35,716 --> 00:47:36,276
Speaker 1: particular.

916
00:47:38,181 --> 00:47:39,928
Speaker 1: It's a unique feeling.

917
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,088
Speaker 1: It's a unique self-feeling unto itself.

918
00:47:43,102 --> 00:47:46,802
Speaker 1: I had a good day, I had a good workout, I

919
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:47,967
Speaker 1: had a good experience.

920
00:47:50,761 --> 00:47:52,685
Speaker 1: I feel good about being me in this world

921
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:53,607
Speaker 1: and life is good.

922
00:47:56,092 --> 00:48:01,767
Speaker 1: Happy ego I've had a terrible day and I

923
00:48:01,787 --> 00:48:10,490
Speaker 1: feel really bad about being me, and we know

924
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,252
Speaker 1: what that feels like.

925
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:17,066
Speaker 1: When we wake into the true self, we

926
00:48:17,247 --> 00:48:22,451
Speaker 1: experience freedom from all the

927
00:48:22,511 --> 00:48:26,870
Speaker 1: constrictions of the ego, positive and

928
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:28,604
Speaker 1: negative, and the feeling is an

929
00:48:28,765 --> 00:48:29,708
Speaker 1: unconditional freedom.

930
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,225
Speaker 1: I've never been born and I've never entered

931
00:48:32,245 --> 00:48:33,509
Speaker 1: the stream of time and nothing ever

932
00:48:33,549 --> 00:48:33,890
Speaker 1: happened.

933
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:38,347
Speaker 1: There never was a problem that needed to be

934
00:48:38,407 --> 00:48:45,763
Speaker 1: overcome, and I know that now that enables

935
00:48:45,803 --> 00:48:50,444
Speaker 1: us to let go of everything and the

936
00:48:50,485 --> 00:48:52,341
Speaker 1: authentic self, in the authentic self, we

937
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:56,475
Speaker 1: feel an overwhelming sense of, we get into

938
00:48:56,556 --> 00:49:00,973
Speaker 1: an overwhelming sense of going into an

939
00:49:00,993 --> 00:49:06,835
Speaker 1: overwhelming sense of responsibility for

940
00:49:06,855 --> 00:49:10,790
Speaker 1: the evolution of the cosmos, and it's when

941
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:12,035
Speaker 1: we experience a great sense of alignment

942
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:18,131
Speaker 1: with the cosmos and with the forces of the

943
00:49:18,151 --> 00:49:20,002
Speaker 1: evolutionary intelligence is driving the

944
00:49:20,022 --> 00:49:20,844
Speaker 1: whole process.

945
00:49:20,864 --> 00:49:22,227
Speaker 1: That's where we wake to this great sense of

946
00:49:22,267 --> 00:49:24,432
Speaker 1: responsibility for being here.

947
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:36,626
Speaker 1: So that's the general idea, but there's one

948
00:49:36,646 --> 00:49:38,350
Speaker 1: more piece of this picture which makes it a

949
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:39,573
Speaker 1: little bit more complicated.

950
00:49:45,103 --> 00:49:48,170
Speaker 1: So I made this distinction several times as

951
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:53,844
Speaker 1: I've been speaking that the the positive

952
00:49:53,945 --> 00:49:57,629
Speaker 1: ego and the negative ego appear in a

953
00:49:57,669 --> 00:50:00,727
Speaker 1: context that's relative and that the true

954
00:50:00,767 --> 00:50:03,024
Speaker 1: self and the authentic self appear in a

955
00:50:03,064 --> 00:50:05,391
Speaker 1: context that's non-relative or absolute,

956
00:50:06,784 --> 00:50:07,307
Speaker 1: which is true.

957
00:50:09,961 --> 00:50:11,146
Speaker 1: But just to make this a little bit more

958
00:50:11,186 --> 00:50:14,229
Speaker 1: complex but understandable, is that the

959
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,341
Speaker 1: what I'm calling the true self and the

960
00:50:20,361 --> 00:50:26,569
Speaker 1: authentic self usually awaken or become

961
00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:32,181
Speaker 1: apparent through the ego structure that

962
00:50:32,201 --> 00:50:46,831
Speaker 1: we're calling the positive ego, because,

963
00:50:46,852 --> 00:50:47,734
Speaker 1: remember, the ego, which is what we call

964
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:49,219
Speaker 1: the frontal self, is a self-structure.

965
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,634
Speaker 1: It's a personality structure, a

966
00:51:04,654 --> 00:51:05,557
Speaker 1: self-structure, a personality structure

967
00:51:05,577 --> 00:51:06,580
Speaker 1: through which consciousness is transmitted.

968
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,384
Speaker 1: So, in this case, I want us to see the

969
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:12,709
Speaker 1: structure of the ego or the frontal self as

970
00:51:12,729 --> 00:51:16,091
Speaker 1: a portal, the ego or the frontal self as a

971
00:51:16,131 --> 00:51:21,035
Speaker 1: portal, the structure or a portal through

972
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:26,675
Speaker 1: which these higher self capacities appear.

973
00:51:27,401 --> 00:51:30,188
Speaker 1: So, for example, if you, if you have an

974
00:51:30,229 --> 00:51:34,345
Speaker 1: experience of in this case you'd say, well,

975
00:51:34,445 --> 00:51:36,798
Speaker 1: if Andrew has an experience of the

976
00:51:36,838 --> 00:51:38,562
Speaker 1: emergence of the presence of the true self,

977
00:51:42,008 --> 00:51:44,672
Speaker 1: the true self would appear, would show up

978
00:51:46,515 --> 00:51:47,964
Speaker 1: through the frontal self structure of

979
00:51:48,024 --> 00:51:51,484
Speaker 1: Andrew's personality, and so the question

980
00:51:51,504 --> 00:51:54,780
Speaker 1: would become well, was it still Andrew?

981
00:51:56,769 --> 00:51:58,134
Speaker 1: And so the question would become well, was

982
00:51:58,155 --> 00:51:59,119
Speaker 1: it still Andrew?

983
00:52:04,451 --> 00:52:06,898
Speaker 1: And you would probably say, well, it was

984
00:52:06,918 --> 00:52:07,600
Speaker 1: his voice, it was his mind.

985
00:52:10,488 --> 00:52:11,351
Speaker 1: I could recognize his mind and his voice

986
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:23,001
Speaker 1: and his memory was there, but and it seemed

987
00:52:23,021 --> 00:52:23,823
Speaker 1: like it was him but he was so different

988
00:52:23,843 --> 00:52:24,705
Speaker 1: because he seemed fearless and cognizant of

989
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:25,768
Speaker 1: an infinite context that, in his relative

990
00:52:25,788 --> 00:52:27,172
Speaker 1: consciousness, he doesn't seem to be aware

991
00:52:27,232 --> 00:52:27,272
Speaker 1: of.

992
00:52:29,662 --> 00:52:32,341
Speaker 1: So, yes, it was still Andrew, but now

993
00:52:32,421 --> 00:52:36,111
Speaker 1: Andrew was full of the consciousness of

994
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:36,632
Speaker 1: eternity.

995
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,966
Speaker 1: So in this, what I'm describing to you, in

996
00:52:41,986 --> 00:52:45,660
Speaker 1: this case, the positive ego becomes, in

997
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,626
Speaker 1: this awakened context, the structure or the

998
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:52,014
Speaker 1: portal through which this true self emerges,

999
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:01,240
Speaker 1: self emerges.

1000
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,403
Speaker 1: So you could say that in this case, in the

1001
00:53:02,423 --> 00:53:03,485
Speaker 1: way I'm describing this, that the ego is

1002
00:53:03,505 --> 00:53:07,873
Speaker 1: still present, but it becomes transmuted or

1003
00:53:07,913 --> 00:53:12,185
Speaker 1: overwhelmed by the presence of this non

1004
00:53:12,225 --> 00:53:14,247
Speaker 1: relative or absolute dimension of the true

1005
00:53:14,267 --> 00:53:14,568
Speaker 1: self.

1006
00:53:25,723 --> 00:53:28,618
Speaker 1: And the same thing is true about the

1007
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:28,940
Speaker 1: authentic self.

1008
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,482
Speaker 1: We can awaken, we can have.

1009
00:53:30,503 --> 00:53:33,978
Speaker 1: We can have, we can awaken to the energy

1010
00:53:33,998 --> 00:53:35,344
Speaker 1: and intelligence that created the universe,

1011
00:53:35,364 --> 00:53:38,142
Speaker 1: the evolutionary impulse, in a way that is

1012
00:53:38,242 --> 00:53:43,004
Speaker 1: mild and subtle or in a way that is

1013
00:53:43,044 --> 00:53:45,171
Speaker 1: completely overwhelming and intense.

1014
00:53:48,301 --> 00:53:49,948
Speaker 1: So you can say, was Andrew still there?

1015
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,262
Speaker 1: You say yes, it was.

1016
00:53:52,303 --> 00:53:54,329
Speaker 1: His voice, his mind, his personality I can

1017
00:53:54,349 --> 00:53:54,871
Speaker 1: recognize.

1018
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,613
Speaker 1: But there was an evolutionary passion, a

1019
00:53:59,633 --> 00:54:02,633
Speaker 1: fearless evolutionary passion, and an

1020
00:54:02,693 --> 00:54:06,852
Speaker 1: ecstatic creativity and care for the

1021
00:54:06,872 --> 00:54:08,297
Speaker 1: evolution of the interior of the cosmos

1022
00:54:08,317 --> 00:54:09,000
Speaker 1: that he was expressing.

1023
00:54:10,669 --> 00:54:12,418
Speaker 1: That's very different than his ordinary

1024
00:54:12,518 --> 00:54:12,840
Speaker 1: state.

1025
00:54:17,193 --> 00:54:18,276
Speaker 1: So the point I'm trying to make here,

1026
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,340
Speaker 1: that's very different than his ordinary

1027
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:19,460
Speaker 1: state.

1028
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:23,508
Speaker 1: So the point I'm trying to make here is

1029
00:54:23,528 --> 00:54:25,654
Speaker 1: that the positive ego tends to be the

1030
00:54:25,674 --> 00:54:27,640
Speaker 1: frontal self-structure or the portal

1031
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,587
Speaker 1: through which these higher self-potentials

1032
00:54:31,629 --> 00:54:36,831
Speaker 1: emerge through us into present reality.

1033
00:54:39,101 --> 00:54:46,073
Speaker 1: And then, finally, if the experience of the

1034
00:54:46,113 --> 00:54:47,602
Speaker 1: presence of the true self and the authentic

1035
00:54:47,642 --> 00:54:53,304
Speaker 1: self is particularly intense which can

1036
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:57,771
Speaker 1: happen to some people sometimes, when the

1037
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,061
Speaker 1: emergence of the true self and the

1038
00:54:59,121 --> 00:55:02,406
Speaker 1: authentic self is particularly intense, it

1039
00:55:02,426 --> 00:55:07,780
Speaker 1: can happen that the frontal ego structure

1040
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:11,048
Speaker 1: in this case Andrew or anybody else could

1041
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:13,240
Speaker 1: or would temporarily disappear altogether.

1042
00:55:14,868 --> 00:55:15,833
Speaker 1: And then you say, well, andrew wasn't there

1043
00:55:15,914 --> 00:55:16,638
Speaker 1: anymore, could or would temporarily

1044
00:55:16,658 --> 00:55:17,120
Speaker 1: disappear altogether.

1045
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:22,876
Speaker 1: And then you say, well, andrew wasn't there

1046
00:55:22,896 --> 00:55:23,217
Speaker 1: anymore.

1047
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:28,400
Speaker 1: There was just the forceful presence, the

1048
00:55:28,982 --> 00:55:31,288
Speaker 1: overwhelming presence of the absolute was

1049
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,245
Speaker 1: coming through him so powerfully that I

1050
00:55:34,285 --> 00:55:35,329
Speaker 1: couldn't find him anymore.

1051
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,686
Speaker 1: He seemed to be completely gone.

1052
00:55:38,761 --> 00:55:41,481
Speaker 1: Or if it was the authentic self, you could

1053
00:55:41,501 --> 00:55:46,822
Speaker 1: say the force of evolution itself, the

1054
00:55:46,902 --> 00:55:48,586
Speaker 1: energy and intelligence of the evolutionary

1055
00:55:49,669 --> 00:55:52,587
Speaker 1: force driving the universe, was all I could

1056
00:55:52,607 --> 00:55:53,028
Speaker 1: see and feel.

1057
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,304
Speaker 1: I couldn't see him anymore.

1058
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:57,422
Speaker 1: It seemed to me that something was coming

1059
00:55:57,462 --> 00:56:02,819
Speaker 1: through him, and that can also happen that

1060
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:09,361
Speaker 1: temporarily, the facade, the facade this is

1061
00:56:09,381 --> 00:56:13,513
Speaker 1: just a facade, facade temporarily the

1062
00:56:13,533 --> 00:56:17,854
Speaker 1: facade of the egoic self-structure can

1063
00:56:18,115 --> 00:56:18,940
Speaker 1: disappear altogether.

1064
00:56:19,282 --> 00:56:22,220
Speaker 1: And if you ever see anybody or with someone

1065
00:56:23,143 --> 00:56:27,730
Speaker 1: who has gone that deep, it can be utterly

1066
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,398
Speaker 1: inspiring and also a little frightening

1067
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:29,800
Speaker 1: sometimes.

1068
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:37,752
Speaker 1: So I think so.

1069
00:56:37,772 --> 00:56:39,021
Speaker 1: Why I like to speak about these

1070
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:46,293
Speaker 1: distinctions is because a lot of us who are

1071
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:47,985
Speaker 1: interested in enlightenment often hear

1072
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:50,668
Speaker 1: about who I really am and all that kind of

1073
00:56:50,689 --> 00:56:57,108
Speaker 1: thing, and the way I think is the most

1074
00:56:57,128 --> 00:56:59,033
Speaker 1: helpful way to think about who I really am

1075
00:57:00,663 --> 00:57:03,289
Speaker 1: is to do this hard spiritual work of

1076
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:07,627
Speaker 1: familiarizing yourselves with these four

1077
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:10,501
Speaker 1: different dimensions of your own self and

1078
00:57:10,521 --> 00:57:11,667
Speaker 1: your own spiritual potential.

1079
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,303
Speaker 1: Because and your own spiritual potential?

1080
00:57:18,308 --> 00:57:22,960
Speaker 1: Because we shouldn't speak too confidently

1081
00:57:23,161 --> 00:57:25,368
Speaker 1: about the presence of the true self, of who

1082
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:29,200
Speaker 1: I really am, unless that is an aspect, a

1083
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,862
Speaker 1: dimension of our own self that we actually

1084
00:57:32,246 --> 00:57:36,082
Speaker 1: have awakened to or can awaken to, because

1085
00:57:36,102 --> 00:57:37,661
Speaker 1: if you're speaking about awakening, coming

1086
00:57:37,701 --> 00:57:38,785
Speaker 1: from your true self, what you really do

1087
00:57:38,805 --> 00:57:39,908
Speaker 1: it's just your ego talking.

1088
00:57:39,928 --> 00:57:40,691
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean anything.

1089
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:43,406
Speaker 1: So we want to make it real.

1090
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,686
Speaker 1: That's the whole idea, is to make it real.

1091
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:52,009
Speaker 1: So that's why I often encourage people to

1092
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:55,798
Speaker 1: do the kinds of spiritual work that's

1093
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:59,157
Speaker 1: necessary to familiarize yourself between

1094
00:57:59,198 --> 00:58:00,833
Speaker 1: the difference between the positive ego and

1095
00:58:00,853 --> 00:58:03,025
Speaker 1: the negative ego, so you can become an

1096
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:06,204
Speaker 1: expert on yourself, so you can become an

1097
00:58:06,264 --> 00:58:11,174
Speaker 1: expert on your own self, so you'll know who

1098
00:58:11,214 --> 00:58:12,863
Speaker 1: you are in any given moment because of how

1099
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:13,405
Speaker 1: you feel.

1100
00:58:15,441 --> 00:58:18,491
Speaker 1: Where is the I am vibrating?

1101
00:58:20,983 --> 00:58:23,591
Speaker 1: Is the I am vibrating in the positive ego?

1102
00:58:25,281 --> 00:58:27,289
Speaker 1: Is the I am vibrating in the negative ego?

1103
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,921
Speaker 1: Is the I am vibrating in the true self or

1104
00:58:30,981 --> 00:58:32,403
Speaker 1: is it vibrating in the authentic self?

1105
00:58:48,886 --> 00:58:51,438
Speaker 1: And becoming familiar with these

1106
00:58:51,459 --> 00:58:55,098
Speaker 1: distinctions, these different dimensions of

1107
00:58:55,118 --> 00:58:56,823
Speaker 1: your own self, can give you an enormous

1108
00:58:56,843 --> 00:58:59,076
Speaker 1: amount of spiritual self-confidence, what I

1109
00:58:59,096 --> 00:59:01,282
Speaker 1: call spiritual self-confidence, when you

1110
00:59:01,322 --> 00:59:03,329
Speaker 1: really know who you are and who you can be,

1111
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:05,360
Speaker 1: and who you are in your best moments.

1112
00:59:07,866 --> 00:59:10,031
Speaker 1: In a way that is not wishy-washy, it's not

1113
00:59:10,112 --> 00:59:12,565
Speaker 1: vague, because what I'm trying to describe

1114
00:59:12,585 --> 00:59:13,729
Speaker 1: to you is very concrete.

1115
00:59:15,081 --> 00:59:16,708
Speaker 1: It's very concrete in my own experience.

1116
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:19,501
Speaker 1: I'm not making this stuff up, I'm

1117
00:59:19,521 --> 00:59:22,129
Speaker 1: describing how I feel from the vantage

1118
00:59:22,149 --> 00:59:23,923
Speaker 1: point of my positive ego, negative ego,

1119
00:59:23,943 --> 00:59:25,569
Speaker 1: true self and authentic self.

1120
00:59:26,581 --> 00:59:28,726
Speaker 1: And I've noticed that the people who are

1121
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:31,882
Speaker 1: familiar with this work and do the practice

1122
00:59:33,507 --> 00:59:34,610
Speaker 1: awaken in similar ways.

1123
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:39,230
Speaker 1: And do the practice awaken in similar ways.

1124
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:43,140
Speaker 1: And especially if we're interested in, if

1125
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,027
Speaker 1: we're seriously interested in, evolutionary

1126
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:44,873
Speaker 1: transformation and awakening to mind

1127
00:59:44,894 --> 00:59:52,493
Speaker 1: awareness, we have to be so committed to

1128
00:59:52,533 --> 00:59:53,901
Speaker 1: these different quadrants, these different

1129
00:59:53,921 --> 00:59:54,905
Speaker 1: dimensions of ourself, so committed to

1130
00:59:54,926 --> 00:59:57,616
Speaker 1: these different quadrants, these different

1131
00:59:57,637 --> 01:00:03,524
Speaker 1: dimensions of ourself we experience very

1132
01:00:03,584 --> 01:00:05,407
Speaker 1: regularly, because the thing we need to

1133
01:00:05,447 --> 01:00:07,890
Speaker 1: experience these higher dimensions of

1134
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,492
Speaker 1: ourself very regularly, because unless we

1135
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:11,915
Speaker 1: do, we'll begin to forget that they exist.

1136
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,345
Speaker 1: Because in this leap from relative reality

1137
01:00:20,385 --> 01:00:21,669
Speaker 1: and relative cognition to absolute reality

1138
01:00:21,689 --> 01:00:22,793
Speaker 1: and absolute cognition is that it's a leap

1139
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:22,993
Speaker 1: from.

1140
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,586
Speaker 1: It's a leap of context, from relative to

1141
01:00:26,687 --> 01:00:27,109
Speaker 1: absolute.

1142
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:31,206
Speaker 1: And the relative context of the ego,

1143
01:00:31,247 --> 01:00:32,991
Speaker 1: whether it's a positive ego or negative ego,

1144
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,448
Speaker 1: has no access to the absolute context.

1145
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:45,507
Speaker 1: The true self and the authentic self can,

1146
01:00:45,647 --> 01:00:47,692
Speaker 1: if need be, see the world, see the relative

1147
01:00:47,732 --> 01:00:54,390
Speaker 1: world, but the relative world of the happy

1148
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:55,962
Speaker 1: ego and the unhappy ego can't see the

1149
01:00:57,105 --> 01:00:58,710
Speaker 1: absolute context of the true self and the

1150
01:00:58,750 --> 01:00:59,231
Speaker 1: authentic self.

1151
01:01:00,401 --> 01:01:01,912
Speaker 1: So, unless we have these kinds of

1152
01:01:02,436 --> 01:01:04,945
Speaker 1: experiences of the true self and authentic

1153
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:10,064
Speaker 1: self on a regular basis, we will tend to

1154
01:01:10,225 --> 01:01:12,231
Speaker 1: lose access to them and tend to forget why

1155
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:18,993
Speaker 1: they're so important, lose access to them

1156
01:01:19,013 --> 01:01:20,256
Speaker 1: and tend to forget why they're so important.

1157
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:21,379
Speaker 1: And that's one of the scary things about

1158
01:01:21,399 --> 01:01:26,877
Speaker 1: awakening, it's one of the frightening

1159
01:01:26,897 --> 01:01:31,645
Speaker 1: parts of all this is that, as I think the

1160
01:01:31,905 --> 01:01:33,589
Speaker 1: Buddha said, as nirvana has no beginning

1161
01:01:33,629 --> 01:01:35,332
Speaker 1: and no end, so samsara also has no

1162
01:01:35,372 --> 01:01:38,739
Speaker 1: beginning and no end, so samsara also has

1163
01:01:38,759 --> 01:01:39,440
Speaker 1: no beginning and no end.

1164
01:01:41,885 --> 01:01:43,229
Speaker 1: So the relative context, in the way I'm

1165
01:01:43,249 --> 01:01:49,784
Speaker 1: speaking now, the relative context is

1166
01:01:49,804 --> 01:01:50,444
Speaker 1: considered to be samsara.

1167
01:01:50,464 --> 01:01:53,268
Speaker 1: So if we take that statement as nirvana has

1168
01:01:53,328 --> 01:01:56,011
Speaker 1: no beginning and no end, so samsara has no

1169
01:01:56,051 --> 01:01:57,032
Speaker 1: beginning and no end, you have to think

1170
01:01:57,052 --> 01:01:57,773
Speaker 1: about what that means.

1171
01:01:57,813 --> 01:01:59,816
Speaker 1: That means when you're in the ego's world.

1172
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,987
Speaker 1: When you're in the ego's world, whether

1173
01:02:07,047 --> 01:02:07,849
Speaker 1: it's positive or negative, it's its own

1174
01:02:07,869 --> 01:02:16,617
Speaker 1: eternal, it becomes its own what seems like

1175
01:02:16,657 --> 01:02:17,360
Speaker 1: eternal domain.

1176
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,322
Speaker 1: So when you are fundamentally identified

1177
01:02:18,342 --> 01:02:19,484
Speaker 1: with the eternal domain, the eternal

1178
01:02:19,504 --> 01:02:22,050
Speaker 1: samsaric domain of the relative ego,

1179
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:27,984
Speaker 1: whether positive or negative, that's all

1180
01:02:28,004 --> 01:02:28,485
Speaker 1: that's real.

1181
01:02:28,566 --> 01:02:30,150
Speaker 1: And in the state of the positive ego and

1182
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:34,468
Speaker 1: the negative ego, it's almost impossible to

1183
01:02:34,488 --> 01:02:37,540
Speaker 1: even imagine that there is a non-relative

1184
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:47,194
Speaker 1: absolute context that exists far beyond it.

1185
01:02:47,214 --> 01:02:48,877
Speaker 1: So as nirvana has no beginning in the wind,

1186
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,694
Speaker 1: samsara has no beginning in the wind also.

1187
01:02:55,321 --> 01:02:56,705
Speaker 1: So that's what's so delicate and precarious

1188
01:02:56,726 --> 01:02:58,170
Speaker 1: about being on the spiritual path in

1189
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:02,830
Speaker 1: earnest is that we can awaken and realize

1190
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:06,699
Speaker 1: and discover so much that is absolute and

1191
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:09,765
Speaker 1: life-changing and in the same way we can

1192
01:03:10,466 --> 01:03:13,793
Speaker 1: lose touch with it and lose access and

1193
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:18,271
Speaker 1: forget and fall, fall out of heaven back

1194
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:18,752
Speaker 1: into hell.

1195
01:03:20,101 --> 01:03:22,126
Speaker 1: So a big part of spiritual practice, as I

1196
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:27,828
Speaker 1: understand it, requires us to pay a great

1197
01:03:27,848 --> 01:03:29,292
Speaker 1: deal of attention to our experience.

1198
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:30,866
Speaker 1: To pay a great deal of attention to our

1199
01:03:30,886 --> 01:03:33,930
Speaker 1: experience, to repeat, to pay a great deal

1200
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:35,883
Speaker 1: of attention to our experience and to

1201
01:03:36,043 --> 01:03:37,427
Speaker 1: really scrutinize our experience from

1202
01:03:37,468 --> 01:03:38,170
Speaker 1: moment to moment.

1203
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,165
Speaker 1: Who am I now?

1204
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,304
Speaker 1: Oh, I know who I am.

1205
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:49,010
Speaker 1: That's my negative ego, uh-huh.

1206
01:03:52,285 --> 01:03:53,620
Speaker 1: So if you're in your negative ego, it's

1207
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:54,744
Speaker 1: better to keep your mouth shut, don't you

1208
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:54,925
Speaker 1: think?

1209
01:03:55,206 --> 01:04:01,282
Speaker 1: Always a good idea If you find that you're,

1210
01:04:01,342 --> 01:04:02,064
Speaker 1: for whatever reason.

1211
01:04:02,084 --> 01:04:03,707
Speaker 1: We don't want to blame anybody for anything,

1212
01:04:03,727 --> 01:04:04,890
Speaker 1: but if you find it, for whatever reason,

1213
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:05,832
Speaker 1: that you are dwelling and abiding and

1214
01:04:05,892 --> 01:04:09,882
Speaker 1: hanging out in your negative ego, better

1215
01:04:10,042 --> 01:04:13,388
Speaker 1: not to say anything to anybody until you

1216
01:04:13,408 --> 01:04:16,053
Speaker 1: get the heck out of there and crawl back up

1217
01:04:16,073 --> 01:04:17,095
Speaker 1: to your positive ego.

1218
01:04:18,741 --> 01:04:20,328
Speaker 1: And if you say, where am I now?

1219
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:21,967
Speaker 1: And you notice you're in your positive ego,

1220
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:27,585
Speaker 1: which is always a good thing, realize, yeah,

1221
01:04:27,646 --> 01:04:29,265
Speaker 1: it's good, but it's only the positive ego,

1222
01:04:29,285 --> 01:04:30,128
Speaker 1: it's only relative.

1223
01:04:32,002 --> 01:04:34,461
Speaker 1: The positive ego is infinitely better than

1224
01:04:34,481 --> 01:04:37,006
Speaker 1: your negative ego, any day of the week, any

1225
01:04:37,046 --> 01:04:40,816
Speaker 1: time of the day, but it's still merely and

1226
01:04:40,897 --> 01:04:41,500
Speaker 1: only relative.

1227
01:04:46,831 --> 01:04:48,274
Speaker 1: And when you're awakened to your true self

1228
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,565
Speaker 1: and you experience the ecstasy of timeless,

1229
01:04:53,605 --> 01:04:55,310
Speaker 1: formless, beginningless and endless eternal

1230
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:59,070
Speaker 1: being and the rapture of eternal being,

1231
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:07,110
Speaker 1: remember, if you can in that state, that

1232
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:11,301
Speaker 1: that is not the whole picture either that

1233
01:05:11,362 --> 01:05:13,990
Speaker 1: God has two aspects.

1234
01:05:15,341 --> 01:05:16,987
Speaker 1: God, which means that which is absolute,

1235
01:05:17,027 --> 01:05:18,584
Speaker 1: has two aspects, and one is being and the

1236
01:05:18,604 --> 01:05:19,267
Speaker 1: other is becoming.

1237
01:05:23,741 --> 01:05:26,108
Speaker 1: So the rapture and peace of the unborn is

1238
01:05:26,148 --> 01:05:27,381
Speaker 1: only half the picture, and the other half

1239
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:30,250
Speaker 1: of the picture is the ecstasy of eternal

1240
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:30,691
Speaker 1: becoming.

1241
01:05:32,841 --> 01:05:34,505
Speaker 1: So we want to learn how to be masters of

1242
01:05:34,545 --> 01:05:37,833
Speaker 1: this process through diligently engaging

1243
01:05:37,853 --> 01:05:40,405
Speaker 1: with spiritual practice, and more than

1244
01:05:40,425 --> 01:05:41,708
Speaker 1: spiritual practice, which is kind of a

1245
01:05:41,728 --> 01:05:45,102
Speaker 1: banal phrase these days, I think.

1246
01:05:46,946 --> 01:05:49,352
Speaker 1: What does it really mean For me?

1247
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:52,899
Speaker 1: It really means that unless you one is

1248
01:05:52,979 --> 01:05:53,906
Speaker 1: deadly serious about the transformational

1249
01:05:53,926 --> 01:05:54,774
Speaker 1: process, unless one is deadly serious about

1250
01:05:54,814 --> 01:05:56,421
Speaker 1: the transformational process, unless one is

1251
01:05:56,441 --> 01:05:58,889
Speaker 1: deadly serious about your own potential for

1252
01:05:58,909 --> 01:06:00,121
Speaker 1: transformation, unless you're willing to

1253
01:06:00,161 --> 01:06:04,792
Speaker 1: take yourself very seriously for all the

1254
01:06:04,852 --> 01:06:06,083
Speaker 1: right reasons, not the wrong reasons,

1255
01:06:06,123 --> 01:06:07,782
Speaker 1: because, as you all know, from the

1256
01:06:07,802 --> 01:06:10,255
Speaker 1: perspective of the negative ego, the

1257
01:06:10,315 --> 01:06:11,741
Speaker 1: wretched negative ego, we all take

1258
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:14,629
Speaker 1: ourselves way too seriously for all the

1259
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:15,431
Speaker 1: wrong reasons.

1260
01:06:15,511 --> 01:06:18,912
Speaker 1: Bad idea, but a much better idea is to

1261
01:06:19,012 --> 01:06:20,423
Speaker 1: learn through practice how to take

1262
01:06:20,463 --> 01:06:23,141
Speaker 1: ourselves seriously, deadly serious, for

1263
01:06:23,161 --> 01:06:24,025
Speaker 1: all the right reasons.

1264
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:26,475
Speaker 1: We have to realize we all have this

1265
01:06:26,536 --> 01:06:28,728
Speaker 1: potential for profound transformation.

1266
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:30,907
Speaker 1: Everybody has that potential within them.

1267
01:06:31,461 --> 01:06:33,148
Speaker 1: Everybody has that potential within them.

1268
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,546
Speaker 1: Everybody has that potential within them,

1269
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,308
Speaker 1: but most people either don't believe it or

1270
01:06:37,328 --> 01:06:38,030
Speaker 1: they squander it.

1271
01:06:41,921 --> 01:06:43,385
Speaker 1: So realize you have that potential within

1272
01:06:43,406 --> 01:06:44,549
Speaker 1: yourself and don't squander it.

1273
01:06:44,569 --> 01:06:46,506
Speaker 1: Take it seriously, take yourself seriously,

1274
01:06:48,522 --> 01:06:49,388
Speaker 1: take your true self.

1275
01:06:49,721 --> 01:06:51,387
Speaker 1: Take your potential to awaken to your true

1276
01:06:51,427 --> 01:06:53,503
Speaker 1: self seriously, take your potential to

1277
01:06:53,523 --> 01:06:55,069
Speaker 1: awaken to your authentic self seriously,

1278
01:06:56,501 --> 01:06:58,047
Speaker 1: because if you do, it'll change your life

1279
01:07:02,941 --> 01:07:03,463
Speaker 1: and the whole.

1280
01:07:03,604 --> 01:07:08,346
Speaker 1: And with the Enlightenment Project, which

1281
01:07:08,386 --> 01:07:10,091
Speaker 1: has been online for the last three or 4,000

1282
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:16,649
Speaker 1: years, 5,000 years, make no mistake about

1283
01:07:16,689 --> 01:07:16,749
Speaker 1: it.

1284
01:07:16,769 --> 01:07:18,082
Speaker 1: To repeat what I said several times, this,

1285
01:07:18,102 --> 01:07:21,822
Speaker 1: this, this flip of this leap from relative

1286
01:07:21,922 --> 01:07:25,231
Speaker 1: reality and relative cognition to absolute

1287
01:07:25,271 --> 01:07:26,884
Speaker 1: reality and absolute cognition, that's the

1288
01:07:26,904 --> 01:07:27,606
Speaker 1: whole ballgame.

1289
01:07:28,569 --> 01:07:29,121
Speaker 1: It's that flip.

1290
01:07:30,364 --> 01:07:31,968
Speaker 1: That's the flip that changes everything.

1291
01:07:33,432 --> 01:07:35,751
Speaker 1: And it changes everything Meaning.

1292
01:07:35,771 --> 01:07:39,426
Speaker 1: It changes everything meaning your.

1293
01:07:39,446 --> 01:07:41,009
Speaker 1: It means your fundamental existential

1294
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:45,543
Speaker 1: relationship to existence, your fundamental

1295
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:48,612
Speaker 1: existential relationship to being here.

1296
01:07:53,583 --> 01:07:54,166
Speaker 1: It's enormous.

1297
01:07:56,681 --> 01:07:58,669
Speaker 1: So for me, the whole practice quote unquote

1298
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:03,304
Speaker 1: is dependent upon you or me, any one of us,

1299
01:08:03,505 --> 01:08:06,283
Speaker 1: taking ourselves seriously for all the

1300
01:08:06,303 --> 01:08:06,865
Speaker 1: right reasons.

1301
01:08:13,261 --> 01:08:14,607
Speaker 1: Because if it's true what the man said,

1302
01:08:15,823 --> 01:08:18,130
Speaker 1: that as nirvana has no beginning and end,

1303
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,783
Speaker 1: so samsara has no beginning and end, we

1304
01:08:20,824 --> 01:08:22,449
Speaker 1: have to be careful about what we're doing

1305
01:08:25,822 --> 01:08:26,525
Speaker 1: and very careful.

1306
01:08:41,565 --> 01:08:42,474
Speaker 1: If you pay attention to these different

1307
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:43,080
Speaker 1: dimensions of your own self.

1308
01:08:44,381 --> 01:08:49,789
Speaker 1: You won't need a psychotherapist, because

1309
01:08:49,809 --> 01:08:51,151
Speaker 1: what's more important than the content of

1310
01:08:51,212 --> 01:08:57,161
Speaker 1: your consciousness, what's more important

1311
01:08:57,181 --> 01:08:59,084
Speaker 1: than the content of your thinking, is where

1312
01:08:59,104 --> 01:08:59,785
Speaker 1: it's coming from.

1313
01:09:01,869 --> 01:09:03,151
Speaker 1: What's the source of the thoughts?

1314
01:09:05,054 --> 01:09:07,421
Speaker 1: If they have a good source, then all is

1315
01:09:07,441 --> 01:09:07,642
Speaker 1: good.

1316
01:09:07,662 --> 01:09:12,165
Speaker 1: If they have a bad source, don't believe

1317
01:09:12,205 --> 01:09:12,565
Speaker 1: any of it.

1318
01:09:23,334 --> 01:09:24,995
Speaker 1: But it takes a lot of courage to do this,

1319
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:27,677
Speaker 1: because we, unless we take ourselves deadly

1320
01:09:27,717 --> 01:09:32,366
Speaker 1: seriously, unless we take our own potential

1321
01:09:32,386 --> 01:09:33,133
Speaker 1: for liberation seriously, we're always

1322
01:09:33,153 --> 01:09:34,881
Speaker 1: going to be interested in the details, but,

1323
01:09:34,901 --> 01:09:35,745
Speaker 1: but, but, but, but.

1324
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:39,687
Speaker 1: And the negative ego is always interested

1325
01:09:39,727 --> 01:09:41,786
Speaker 1: in the details, insisting on the details.

1326
01:09:42,642 --> 01:09:46,747
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter, it's all garbage anyway,

1327
01:09:47,921 --> 01:09:49,206
Speaker 1: but this little piece of garbage is very

1328
01:09:49,266 --> 01:09:49,909
Speaker 1: important.

1329
01:09:51,942 --> 01:09:54,736
Speaker 1: Say no, it's not, because it's garbage.

1330
01:09:54,756 --> 01:09:56,739
Speaker 1: Because it's garbage, it becomes irrelevant.

1331
01:09:59,427 --> 01:10:00,932
Speaker 1: And then we see how messed up we really are,

1332
01:10:01,485 --> 01:10:03,180
Speaker 1: because we're holding up a piece of garbage

1333
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:07,808
Speaker 1: that's dirty and smells bad and we don't

1334
01:10:07,848 --> 01:10:08,470
Speaker 1: want to give up.

1335
01:10:09,991 --> 01:10:13,560
Speaker 1: That's the definition of crazy, right,

1336
01:10:21,815 --> 01:10:22,977
Speaker 1: right, that's the definition of crazy right.

1337
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:24,362
Speaker 1: So a big part of this kind of growth

1338
01:10:24,382 --> 01:10:26,568
Speaker 1: process is learning how to become more

1339
01:10:26,628 --> 01:10:31,303
Speaker 1: cognizant of the contexts, the inner

1340
01:10:31,343 --> 01:10:33,242
Speaker 1: context in which we're swimming and where

1341
01:10:33,302 --> 01:10:36,223
Speaker 1: we're locating ourself, what we're

1342
01:10:36,243 --> 01:10:36,945
Speaker 1: identifying with.

1343
01:10:37,306 --> 01:10:41,948
Speaker 1: Where are we, where am I, where are we?

1344
01:10:46,301 --> 01:10:47,745
Speaker 1: And the reason why the meditation process

1345
01:10:47,825 --> 01:10:49,369
Speaker 1: is so important is it can help us to get

1346
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:50,332
Speaker 1: out of this ego field, even the positive

1347
01:10:50,352 --> 01:10:50,412
Speaker 1: ego.

1348
01:10:50,432 --> 01:10:52,959
Speaker 1: And it can help us to get out of this ego

1349
01:10:52,999 --> 01:11:00,178
Speaker 1: field, even the positive ego.

1350
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,609
Speaker 1: Because even things that seem very

1351
01:11:01,629 --> 01:11:03,161
Speaker 1: important to the positive ego, which is

1352
01:11:03,221 --> 01:11:06,083
Speaker 1: usually all positive stuff, when you wake

1353
01:11:06,143 --> 01:11:08,029
Speaker 1: up to the true self or the authentic self,

1354
01:11:08,229 --> 01:11:09,442
Speaker 1: suddenly you realize, yeah, yeah, but it's

1355
01:11:09,502 --> 01:11:10,748
Speaker 1: all relative, so it doesn't matter.

1356
01:11:13,961 --> 01:11:14,503
Speaker 1: That's the whole point.

1357
01:11:14,523 --> 01:11:15,267
Speaker 1: That's the whole point.

1358
01:11:18,581 --> 01:11:22,630
Speaker 1: That's the big leap from samsara to nirvana.

1359
01:11:31,103 --> 01:11:32,395
Speaker 1: Now imagine what it would be like if we had

1360
01:11:32,436 --> 01:11:34,206
Speaker 1: a friendship and we made an agreement with

1361
01:11:34,226 --> 01:11:38,590
Speaker 1: each other, say, andrew, I'm not going to

1362
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:47,125
Speaker 1: talk to you, I'm just making this up.

1363
01:11:47,741 --> 01:11:48,665
Speaker 1: It's kind of half a joke.

1364
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,818
Speaker 1: Let's say what if we had made an agreement

1365
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:51,922
Speaker 1: to say, andrew, I'm not going to talk to

1366
01:11:51,962 --> 01:11:54,188
Speaker 1: you unless you're coming from your

1367
01:11:55,531 --> 01:11:56,193
Speaker 1: authentic self.

1368
01:11:58,101 --> 01:11:59,184
Speaker 1: I'm not even going to talk to you if you're

1369
01:11:59,204 --> 01:12:00,307
Speaker 1: coming from your positive ego?

1370
01:12:00,889 --> 01:12:02,625
Speaker 1: I said, whoa, that's pretty strong stuff.

1371
01:12:05,624 --> 01:12:07,882
Speaker 1: And then you'd say to me and said you also

1372
01:12:07,922 --> 01:12:09,367
Speaker 1: don't speak to me unless I'm coming from an

1373
01:12:09,427 --> 01:12:10,049
Speaker 1: authentic self.

1374
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,626
Speaker 1: That would make for a very dynamic

1375
01:12:19,646 --> 01:12:19,907
Speaker 1: relationship.

1376
01:12:19,927 --> 01:12:21,270
Speaker 1: It might not be the kind of thing we want

1377
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:21,972
Speaker 1: to do all the time.

1378
01:12:25,089 --> 01:12:28,388
Speaker 1: But if we would narrow down our focus in

1379
01:12:28,408 --> 01:12:31,289
Speaker 1: that way, it could yield some very profound,

1380
01:12:33,446 --> 01:12:35,090
Speaker 1: extremely transformative results.

1381
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:40,986
Speaker 1: And to the ego it sounds like a terrible,

1382
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,727
Speaker 1: an overwhelming degree of renunciation.

1383
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:48,712
Speaker 1: You say, wow, yeah, but it's all good.
