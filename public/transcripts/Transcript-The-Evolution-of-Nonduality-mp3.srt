1
00:00:01,183 --> 00:00:03,489
Speaker 1: So non-duality is the beginning and the end

2
00:00:03,549 --> 00:00:04,651
Speaker 1: of the entire discussion about

3
00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:05,233
Speaker 1: enlightenment.

4
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:10,205
Speaker 1: The search for non-duality is the search

5
00:00:10,285 --> 00:00:13,172
Speaker 1: for the ultimate truth about the nature of

6
00:00:13,232 --> 00:00:13,713
Speaker 1: reality.

7
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:16,287
Speaker 1: So it's not a small subject.

8
00:00:20,282 --> 00:00:21,973
Speaker 1: So it's a search for the ultimate truth

9
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:23,080
Speaker 1: about the nature of reality.

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,313
Speaker 1: So it's a search for the ultimate truth

11
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:27,960
Speaker 1: about the nature of reality.

12
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,580
Speaker 1: And, as I'm fond of repeating, the

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,242
Speaker 1: Buddhists make a very compelling

14
00:00:34,262 --> 00:00:37,831
Speaker 1: distinction that I always find helpful and

15
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:42,289
Speaker 1: inspiring, and they make a distinction

16
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,360
Speaker 1: between two different levels of reality.

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,683
Speaker 1: And they make a distinction between two

18
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:46,685
Speaker 1: different levels of reality One level of

19
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:49,652
Speaker 1: reality being, which is called relative

20
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:53,484
Speaker 1: reality, which is relatively real, and

21
00:00:53,545 --> 00:00:55,429
Speaker 1: another level of reality which is the level

22
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:57,333
Speaker 1: of the absolute or the absolute reality.

23
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:07,103
Speaker 1: So there's a distinction, there's this very

24
00:01:07,123 --> 00:01:09,107
Speaker 1: interesting distinction between relative

25
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:10,590
Speaker 1: reality, relative cognition, relative

26
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,806
Speaker 1: experience, relative knowing and absolute

27
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:16,777
Speaker 1: reality, in which we experience absolute

28
00:01:16,818 --> 00:01:20,050
Speaker 1: cognition and absolute knowing.

29
00:01:22,463 --> 00:01:24,088
Speaker 1: So it's when we take the leap from relative

30
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:26,838
Speaker 1: cognition and relative knowing to absolute

31
00:01:26,858 --> 00:01:31,889
Speaker 1: cognition and absolute knowing that we

32
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,571
Speaker 1: glimpse what universally has been

33
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:37,538
Speaker 1: considered to be the highest level of

34
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,528
Speaker 1: reality and the highest truth, which is the

35
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:41,879
Speaker 1: ultimate truth of non-duality.

36
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,208
Speaker 1: So the ultimate truth of non-duality, so

37
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,116
Speaker 1: the ultimate truth of non-duality, tells us

38
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:53,774
Speaker 1: that the final answer to all questions?

39
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,407
Speaker 1: The final answer to all spiritual questions

40
00:01:57,302 --> 00:01:59,100
Speaker 1: is that the ultimate nature of reality, the

41
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:00,380
Speaker 1: ultimate nature of the truth, is that

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:13,072
Speaker 1: there's only one and not two, is that

43
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,153
Speaker 1: there's only one and not two.

44
00:02:14,193 --> 00:02:15,314
Speaker 1: And we're told that the experience of that

45
00:02:15,374 --> 00:02:21,841
Speaker 1: undivided oneness, which is not two-ness,

46
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:23,045
Speaker 1: is the source of liberation and the source

47
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:24,570
Speaker 1: of the awakening to enlightened awareness,

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,647
Speaker 1: the source of the experience of

49
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:29,104
Speaker 1: enlightenment itself, the source of the

50
00:02:29,164 --> 00:02:31,593
Speaker 1: experience that all of the most realized

51
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:34,686
Speaker 1: masters have spoken to us about.

52
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:42,147
Speaker 1: So before I speak about the evolution of

53
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:42,722
Speaker 1: non-duality, I just want to speak a little

54
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:42,891
Speaker 1: bit about non-duality itself.

55
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:42,947
Speaker 1: So, before I speak about the evolution of

56
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:47,971
Speaker 1: non-duality, I just want to speak a little

57
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:59,892
Speaker 1: bit about non-duality itself, because it's

58
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:05,320
Speaker 1: very subtle and it's not so easy to see,

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,919
Speaker 1: because we're used to seeing objects that

60
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:07,544
Speaker 1: exist outside of ourselves.

61
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:07,945
Speaker 1: We're used to seeing things.

62
00:03:08,868 --> 00:03:10,653
Speaker 1: We're not used to perceiving reality as a

63
00:03:10,753 --> 00:03:13,280
Speaker 1: whole, but we're used to seeing objects

64
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,566
Speaker 1: that appear in reality.

65
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,745
Speaker 1: So the experience of non-duality is when we

66
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:24,878
Speaker 1: have a direct gnosis or a direct knowing of

67
00:03:24,898 --> 00:03:26,744
Speaker 1: the meta-context of everything that exists

68
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:27,908
Speaker 1: and everything that doesn't exist.

69
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:31,607
Speaker 1: It's a meta-context of everything that

70
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:33,371
Speaker 1: exists and everything that does not exist,

71
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:42,792
Speaker 1: and it is a seeing and a knowing and a

72
00:03:42,852 --> 00:03:44,534
Speaker 1: recognition in which there's no subject and

73
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:45,235
Speaker 1: there's no object.

74
00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:48,887
Speaker 1: So it's very difficult to understand with

75
00:03:48,907 --> 00:03:50,585
Speaker 1: the mind, it's very difficult to understand

76
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:55,824
Speaker 1: with the intellect, it's impossible to

77
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:56,708
Speaker 1: understand with the ego.

78
00:03:59,482 --> 00:04:03,553
Speaker 1: So it's very tricky, it's very slippery,

79
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:05,804
Speaker 1: it's very subtle, it's very mysterious.

80
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:06,806
Speaker 1: And it's very slippery, it's very subtle,

81
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:09,373
Speaker 1: it's very mysterious and it's very absolute.

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,785
Speaker 1: So one of the many reasons why this is such

83
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:17,430
Speaker 1: a difficult topic and such a difficult

84
00:04:18,412 --> 00:04:23,586
Speaker 1: experience to grasp is because we can say,

85
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:24,748
Speaker 1: from a certain point of view, that this

86
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:28,934
Speaker 1: truth exists everywhere and nowhere

87
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:29,816
Speaker 1: simultaneously.

88
00:04:32,624 --> 00:04:34,229
Speaker 1: And the reason that most of us have so much

89
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:39,598
Speaker 1: trouble getting non-duality, really getting

90
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:43,966
Speaker 1: it very deeply, getting a real, deep, solid,

91
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:51,421
Speaker 1: stable understanding to it, of it, it's

92
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:55,009
Speaker 1: because we have been trained in the way

93
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,182
Speaker 1: we've been trained in the art of perception

94
00:04:57,222 --> 00:04:58,928
Speaker 1: and the art of cognition to see objects.

95
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,797
Speaker 1: We've been taught, through the way we've

96
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:07,706
Speaker 1: been educated by our parents and by our

97
00:05:10,257 --> 00:05:13,847
Speaker 1: system of learning, to focus more on

98
00:05:14,007 --> 00:05:16,193
Speaker 1: objects than on context.

99
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:25,807
Speaker 1: So the search for enlightenment, which is

100
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:27,551
Speaker 1: the search for non-duality or the ultimate

101
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:32,245
Speaker 1: oneness that's not two is the search for

102
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,250
Speaker 1: the ultimate and absolute context for all

103
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,555
Speaker 1: experience and non-experience.

104
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:44,053
Speaker 1: This is the search for the meta-context in

105
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:45,800
Speaker 1: which everything that exists and everything

106
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,325
Speaker 1: that doesn't exist appear and disappear.

107
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,867
Speaker 1: So if we've been trained since day one to

108
00:05:55,907 --> 00:06:01,780
Speaker 1: look at objects and not at context, it's

109
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,711
Speaker 1: going to be very difficult for us to awaken

110
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:05,762
Speaker 1: to the ultimate metacontext in which all

111
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:08,009
Speaker 1: things exist and don't exist.

112
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:13,687
Speaker 1: So this is why, in all the training, in all

113
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:18,254
Speaker 1: the spiritual training that is designed to

114
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,746
Speaker 1: help us to awaken to non-duality, we're

115
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:24,988
Speaker 1: always told to stop looking at objects and

116
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:27,420
Speaker 1: stop trying to see anything particular.

117
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:31,149
Speaker 1: And a lot of people find it very

118
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:33,991
Speaker 1: frustrating because they say well I'm, if I

119
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:36,395
Speaker 1: let go of objects and I stop trying to see

120
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:38,186
Speaker 1: anything, what am I supposed to be doing?

121
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:47,109
Speaker 1: Because we're told that the experience of

122
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,608
Speaker 1: life that includes conscious self-awareness

123
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:53,843
Speaker 1: is always by doing something, getting from

124
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:54,606
Speaker 1: point A to point B.

125
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:03,264
Speaker 1: And we say no, if you want to discover the

126
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:06,283
Speaker 1: ultimate metacontext or absolute context

127
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:09,201
Speaker 1: for all experience and non-experience, you

128
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,469
Speaker 1: have to stop looking for anything at all.

129
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:14,586
Speaker 1: Stop looking for anything.

130
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:20,887
Speaker 1: But if you're trying to stop looking for

131
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:24,341
Speaker 1: anything with your ego mind, you're going

132
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,747
Speaker 1: to experience enormous frustration.

133
00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:28,145
Speaker 1: A lot of people do.

134
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,211
Speaker 1: You've all heard me tell this story many

135
00:07:49,231 --> 00:07:50,598
Speaker 1: times about this experience I had with my

136
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:55,486
Speaker 1: teacher when I returned to see him after

137
00:07:55,546 --> 00:07:58,448
Speaker 1: several months and walked into the room and

138
00:07:58,488 --> 00:08:01,306
Speaker 1: saw him and he smiled and said Andrew, I'm

139
00:08:01,326 --> 00:08:03,907
Speaker 1: so happy you found a friend that you'll

140
00:08:03,927 --> 00:08:04,770
Speaker 1: never be able to see.

141
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,155
Speaker 1: I'm so happy you found a friend that you'll

142
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:09,878
Speaker 1: never be able to see.

143
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:13,836
Speaker 1: I'm so happy you found a friend you'll

144
00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:14,620
Speaker 1: never be able to see.

145
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:22,898
Speaker 1: I'm so very happy you found a friend you'll

146
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:23,820
Speaker 1: never be able to see.

147
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,001
Speaker 1: So in the search for enlightenment, which

148
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:28,102
Speaker 1: is the search for your own true self, if

149
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:29,964
Speaker 1: you're successful in your search, if you

150
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:33,167
Speaker 1: find what you're looking for, if you find

151
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:36,410
Speaker 1: what you're looking for and there's a very

152
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:38,052
Speaker 1: clear distinction between being a seeker

153
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:41,576
Speaker 1: and a finder so if you actually found what

154
00:08:41,616 --> 00:08:49,288
Speaker 1: you're looking for, if you've reached the

155
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:51,919
Speaker 1: yonder shore and put your feet on that warm

156
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,244
Speaker 1: sand, then you have found that friend

157
00:08:53,264 --> 00:08:56,599
Speaker 1: you'll never be able to see.

158
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:13,615
Speaker 1: So so something big happens when we become

159
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:15,657
Speaker 1: more interested in the ultimate context for

160
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:18,163
Speaker 1: all experience and non-experience than we

161
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,488
Speaker 1: are in the objects that exist all around us.

162
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,907
Speaker 1: Because when you actually wake up to

163
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:33,071
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness and you discover this

164
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:37,046
Speaker 1: metacontext or absolute context, which is

165
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:38,837
Speaker 1: the leap from relative reality and relative

166
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,404
Speaker 1: consciousness and cognition to absolute

167
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:42,169
Speaker 1: reality and absolute consciousness and

168
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:46,869
Speaker 1: cognition, you discover, to your delight

169
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:50,567
Speaker 1: and to your surprise, that this

170
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:56,585
Speaker 1: meta-context is speaking to you and

171
00:09:56,645 --> 00:09:58,489
Speaker 1: revealing truths and perspectives and ways

172
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,071
Speaker 1: of knowing and unknowing and ways of

173
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:03,719
Speaker 1: cognition, types of cognition that are

174
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:06,165
Speaker 1: simply unavailable in relative

175
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,891
Speaker 1: consciousness and relative cognition and

176
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:09,713
Speaker 1: relative knowing.

177
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,316
Speaker 1: So one way we could say it is to let go of

178
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:22,731
Speaker 1: everything so you can see the totality of

179
00:10:22,851 --> 00:10:28,938
Speaker 1: all things, so you can see the totality of

180
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:29,319
Speaker 1: all things.

181
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,836
Speaker 1: Let go of everything so you can see the

182
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:32,300
Speaker 1: totality of all things.

183
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,706
Speaker 1: But the totality of all things is not a

184
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:34,987
Speaker 1: thing.

185
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,024
Speaker 1: When we use language, we always speak in

186
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:49,970
Speaker 1: terms of seeing objects, we think of seeing

187
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:54,826
Speaker 1: something, but the metacognition of

188
00:10:54,906 --> 00:10:56,570
Speaker 1: absolute reality is not seeing anything

189
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:57,072
Speaker 1: particular.

190
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,752
Speaker 1: It's a knowing of non-relative or absolute

191
00:11:01,772 --> 00:11:09,788
Speaker 1: gnosis of non-relative or absolute gnosis.

192
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:13,955
Speaker 1: It's a mysterious kind of metacognition,

193
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:21,701
Speaker 1: understanding and knowing in which all of

194
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:23,045
Speaker 1: our human and relative concerns and fears

195
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:29,125
Speaker 1: and desires are all abated, they fall away

196
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:32,886
Speaker 1: from us and we, at least temporarily,

197
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:35,425
Speaker 1: become unconcerned with everything we're

198
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,485
Speaker 1: afraid of, with everything we think we want,

199
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:41,735
Speaker 1: because we're so stunned with the

200
00:11:41,775 --> 00:11:44,787
Speaker 1: revelation and gnosis of that which is

201
00:11:44,908 --> 00:11:45,891
Speaker 1: absolute and unrelative.

202
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:53,847
Speaker 1: The revelation of absolute reality answers

203
00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:55,122
Speaker 1: all of our questions, including the

204
00:11:55,142 --> 00:11:56,347
Speaker 1: questions we didn't even know we had.

205
00:11:58,322 --> 00:12:01,788
Speaker 1: It quiets us down, it calms our heart and

206
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:05,649
Speaker 1: soul and relieves us of all of our fears

207
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,403
Speaker 1: and our existential doubts and worries in a

208
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:13,028
Speaker 1: way that nothing else can.

209
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,741
Speaker 1: It's like coming home.

210
00:12:20,203 --> 00:12:40,077
Speaker 1: Now, how we approach this kind of

211
00:12:40,117 --> 00:12:41,618
Speaker 1: experience is not really important.

212
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:48,129
Speaker 1: Some methods claim to be instantaneous and

213
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:50,013
Speaker 1: others claim that they take time and

214
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:50,494
Speaker 1: practice.

215
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:53,265
Speaker 1: And it doesn't really matter how you

216
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:57,098
Speaker 1: approach this enormous existential and

217
00:12:57,118 --> 00:12:58,602
Speaker 1: metaphysical challenge, but what's

218
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:00,205
Speaker 1: important is that you actually succeed.

219
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:06,938
Speaker 1: It's important that you actually succeed

220
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:07,800
Speaker 1: and have the breakthrough.

221
00:13:08,992 --> 00:13:09,820
Speaker 1: It changes everything.

222
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:15,804
Speaker 1: And it's also important to gain access to

223
00:13:15,824 --> 00:13:19,723
Speaker 1: metacognition and to gnosis and absolute

224
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:24,791
Speaker 1: reality on a regular basis, because what's

225
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:27,364
Speaker 1: the metacontext in which the experience of

226
00:13:27,384 --> 00:13:28,889
Speaker 1: being you or the experience of being human

227
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:29,411
Speaker 1: is happening?

228
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:34,842
Speaker 1: The meta-context is absolute reality or the

229
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:35,564
Speaker 1: absolute knowing.

230
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:36,406
Speaker 1: That's non-dual.

231
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:46,490
Speaker 1: And when, when you awaken and you reawaken,

232
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:50,115
Speaker 1: you remember who you are and where you are

233
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:53,064
Speaker 1: Very easy to forget.

234
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:57,820
Speaker 1: Most people do so.

235
00:13:57,861 --> 00:14:04,676
Speaker 1: It's only when we awaken and reawaken, and

236
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:06,641
Speaker 1: reawaken yet again on a regular basis, that

237
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:12,036
Speaker 1: we can stay on the path and not get

238
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:15,609
Speaker 1: distracted by this or by that or by

239
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:16,231
Speaker 1: something else.

240
00:14:19,621 --> 00:14:21,341
Speaker 1: Like I often say, it's easy to wake up and

241
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,867
Speaker 1: it's much easier to fall back to sleep.

242
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,979
Speaker 1: It's easy to wake up, but it's much easier

243
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:25,195
Speaker 1: to fall back to sleep.

244
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:27,055
Speaker 1: It's easy to wake up, but it's very hard to

245
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:27,616
Speaker 1: stay awake.

246
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,730
Speaker 1: So, if you do the work, if you do the hard

247
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,366
Speaker 1: work that you need to do to stay awake,

248
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,366
Speaker 1: then you continue to put one foot in front

249
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:44,949
Speaker 1: of the other and you won't step in and out

250
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:46,076
Speaker 1: of higher consciousness and you'll stay in,

251
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:47,422
Speaker 1: in and out of higher consciousness and

252
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:49,541
Speaker 1: you'll stay in it and aware of it because

253
00:14:49,561 --> 00:14:52,008
Speaker 1: you'll be giving it the priority that it

254
00:14:52,088 --> 00:14:53,412
Speaker 1: needs to be remembered.

255
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:04,207
Speaker 1: So, if we say non-duality is oneness, which

256
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:13,409
Speaker 1: is very common, it's true of it's true, of

257
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:15,878
Speaker 1: course it's true, but it doesn't really say

258
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:16,099
Speaker 1: what it is.

259
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,862
Speaker 1: Because, as I was saying, in this absolute

260
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:23,683
Speaker 1: cognition, in this absolute gnosis, there

261
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:29,175
Speaker 1: is the mysterious, miraculous knowing of

262
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:29,876
Speaker 1: all things.

263
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,424
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean that you know this and you

264
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,529
Speaker 1: know that and you know the other thing.

265
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,421
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean omniscience, but it means

266
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:39,425
Speaker 1: you know the ultimate truth.

267
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,645
Speaker 1: Even if you're still learning about

268
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:44,304
Speaker 1: relative things and relative reality and

269
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:47,188
Speaker 1: relative truths and relative perspectives,

270
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,703
Speaker 1: as we all will continue to do, hopefully,

271
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:57,164
Speaker 1: for as long as we live, the absolute truth

272
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:03,389
Speaker 1: is the truth that liberates us, because it

273
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:08,350
Speaker 1: transmits to us, faster than the mind can

274
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:13,063
Speaker 1: understand the ultimate mystery that

275
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:17,841
Speaker 1: transcends life and death the secret of

276
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:18,662
Speaker 1: immortality.

277
00:16:30,715 --> 00:16:36,561
Speaker 1: It's not this or that, it's everything, and

278
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:40,083
Speaker 1: it's the absolute context, the knowing of

279
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:49,855
Speaker 1: which changes absolutely everything, of

280
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,117
Speaker 1: which changes absolutely everything.

281
00:16:53,772 --> 00:16:55,121
Speaker 1: We gain access to non-duality and the

282
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:59,118
Speaker 1: inconceivable and absolute liberation that

283
00:16:59,138 --> 00:16:59,419
Speaker 1: is its gift.

284
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,940
Speaker 1: By letting go of everything else, by

285
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,547
Speaker 1: letting go of absolutely everything else,

286
00:17:09,622 --> 00:17:14,422
Speaker 1: by letting go of everything else, and if we

287
00:17:14,462 --> 00:17:16,408
Speaker 1: have the courage and inspired intention to

288
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:18,963
Speaker 1: let go of everything else, that mystery

289
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,831
Speaker 1: will begin to reveal itself to us in its

290
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:29,556
Speaker 1: own time and in its own way, but it will to

291
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:30,739
Speaker 1: us in its own time and in its own way, but

292
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:30,940
Speaker 1: it will.

293
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,065
Speaker 1: If you still believe that something else is

294
00:17:33,105 --> 00:17:36,437
Speaker 1: going to make you truly happy and set you

295
00:17:36,457 --> 00:17:36,859
Speaker 1: free, it won't happen.

296
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,284
Speaker 1: That's why I always use the metaphor of

297
00:17:45,324 --> 00:17:46,507
Speaker 1: jumping out of an airplane without a

298
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:46,988
Speaker 1: parachute.

299
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,235
Speaker 1: As I always say, someone's going to jump

300
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:55,580
Speaker 1: out of an airplane without a parachute only

301
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,904
Speaker 1: if they have no intention of coming back.

302
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,665
Speaker 1: So non-dual means absolutely everything,

303
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:04,330
Speaker 1: everything, everything, everything.

304
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:14,111
Speaker 1: It means letting it all go and having the

305
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:26,497
Speaker 1: courage to let it all go, having the trust

306
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:34,843
Speaker 1: to let it all go, and it means really

307
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,648
Speaker 1: wanting to know what the truth is for

308
00:18:35,668 --> 00:18:35,829
Speaker 1: yourself.

309
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:36,734
Speaker 1: You have to believe that you can know what

310
00:18:36,754 --> 00:18:37,559
Speaker 1: the absolute truth is.

311
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,963
Speaker 1: You have to believe you're capable of it

312
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,105
Speaker 1: and you have to want to know what it is.

313
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,205
Speaker 1: You have to come to the point where you

314
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:49,429
Speaker 1: feel I will never be able to truly make

315
00:18:49,489 --> 00:18:52,605
Speaker 1: sense out of the human experience unless I

316
00:18:52,645 --> 00:18:54,170
Speaker 1: can realize what the absolute truth is.

317
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:58,627
Speaker 1: I've always, personally, I've always felt

318
00:18:58,667 --> 00:18:58,828
Speaker 1: that.

319
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:06,984
Speaker 1: You know, the way it works these days is

320
00:19:07,004 --> 00:19:09,808
Speaker 1: that people tend to become serious seekers

321
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,791
Speaker 1: or seekers not necessarily serious ones,

322
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:12,372
Speaker 1: but seekers.

323
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:23,604
Speaker 1: Later in life I realize I'm lost and I'm

324
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:24,187
Speaker 1: not happy.

325
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,400
Speaker 1: I give up.

326
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,864
Speaker 1: It's a good place to come to, if you mean

327
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:40,246
Speaker 1: it, but I've always thought and I have a

328
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:43,191
Speaker 1: habit of liking to think in idealistic

329
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:51,409
Speaker 1: terms, idealistic utopian terms.

330
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:54,654
Speaker 1: Then it would be.

331
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,889
Speaker 1: Wouldn't it be wonderful for all of us, for

332
00:19:57,949 --> 00:20:00,823
Speaker 1: our whole species and for the planet, if we

333
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:07,694
Speaker 1: human beings who are well-educated and

334
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:13,088
Speaker 1: reasonably well-off could focus on what's

335
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,814
Speaker 1: most important when we're still very young,

336
00:20:16,661 --> 00:20:26,594
Speaker 1: before we mess it all up, because, of

337
00:20:26,634 --> 00:20:30,642
Speaker 1: course, the ultimate context, the meta

338
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,828
Speaker 1: context that I'm speaking about, will help

339
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:33,636
Speaker 1: us to make sense out of human experience,

340
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:35,156
Speaker 1: will help us to make sense out of our own

341
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:36,746
Speaker 1: experience in the best possible way.

342
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:53,142
Speaker 1: It's like being in a ship, a sailing ship,

343
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:54,107
Speaker 1: and having to climb to the top of the

344
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,439
Speaker 1: highest mass in order to be able to see

345
00:20:56,459 --> 00:20:56,720
Speaker 1: where you are.

346
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,322
Speaker 1: So if we could begin to do that work when

347
00:20:58,362 --> 00:21:04,688
Speaker 1: we're relatively young, and if we could be

348
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:09,594
Speaker 1: taught about what's truly important in

349
00:21:10,555 --> 00:21:14,121
Speaker 1: terms of values when we're very young, when

350
00:21:14,161 --> 00:21:16,467
Speaker 1: we could wake up and become enlightened

351
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:20,683
Speaker 1: when we're still very young, just think of

352
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:22,829
Speaker 1: the kind of beautiful world we could create

353
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,803
Speaker 1: together A sane world.

354
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:30,842
Speaker 1: The sane world, not an insane world, but a

355
00:21:30,902 --> 00:21:32,869
Speaker 1: deeply sane world where things made sense

356
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,388
Speaker 1: and where we made very beautiful sense out

357
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:39,702
Speaker 1: of the gift of life, because we were seeing

358
00:21:41,104 --> 00:21:42,746
Speaker 1: the context of this meta-perspective and

359
00:21:42,766 --> 00:21:43,787
Speaker 1: this absolute perspective.

360
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,213
Speaker 1: But that's not the world we're living in,

361
00:21:57,253 --> 00:21:58,900
Speaker 1: obviously.

362
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:01,104
Speaker 1: So we tend to begin to wake up later in

363
00:22:01,124 --> 00:22:02,629
Speaker 1: life, after we've stumbled a few times and

364
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:05,807
Speaker 1: fallen a few times and probably made some

365
00:22:05,847 --> 00:22:10,651
Speaker 1: important mistakes and realized how much we

366
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:12,586
Speaker 1: don't know and how lost we really are.

367
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:26,869
Speaker 1: It takes enormous humility to wake up to

368
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:29,263
Speaker 1: absolute reality, and it takes even more

369
00:22:29,303 --> 00:22:31,150
Speaker 1: humility to stay awake once you've woken up.

370
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,288
Speaker 1: Unfortunately, when some people wake up in

371
00:22:38,348 --> 00:22:41,465
Speaker 1: a genuine way, their ego grabs onto the

372
00:22:41,505 --> 00:22:42,790
Speaker 1: experience and they think they're special.

373
00:22:44,962 --> 00:22:48,686
Speaker 1: Now I've arrived Very dangerous thing to do,

374
00:22:57,121 --> 00:22:59,909
Speaker 1: and especially for us children of

375
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:00,792
Speaker 1: post-modernity.

376
00:23:02,602 --> 00:23:03,968
Speaker 1: We're all children of post-modernity.

377
00:23:03,988 --> 00:23:05,013
Speaker 1: We tend to have big egos.

378
00:23:06,078 --> 00:23:07,302
Speaker 1: We've been culturally conditioned to think

379
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:09,369
Speaker 1: a lot of ourselves and to be very

380
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:13,241
Speaker 1: self-infatuated with the small self.

381
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:16,426
Speaker 1: It makes it harder to wake up, harder to

382
00:23:16,446 --> 00:23:16,786
Speaker 1: let go.

383
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:44,247
Speaker 1: So the thing that's so challenging about

384
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:46,972
Speaker 1: the awakening to enlightened awareness and

385
00:23:47,032 --> 00:23:49,097
Speaker 1: its lead to becoming stabilized and gaining

386
00:23:49,198 --> 00:23:52,412
Speaker 1: access to non-dual gnosis, non-dual

387
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:56,177
Speaker 1: cognition and non-dual knowing is that we

388
00:23:56,198 --> 00:23:57,851
Speaker 1: have to keep letting go of everything to be

389
00:23:57,912 --> 00:24:01,542
Speaker 1: able to sustain that level of consciousness.

390
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,503
Speaker 1: We've got to keep letting go of everything

391
00:24:04,447 --> 00:24:05,050
Speaker 1: to sustain that level of consciousness.

392
00:24:04,994 --> 00:24:05,726
Speaker 1: We've got to keep letting go of everything

393
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:07,836
Speaker 1: to sustain that level of consciousness.

394
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:13,258
Speaker 1: Start at the beginning, again back to zero.

395
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:15,659
Speaker 1: Start at the beginning, again back to zero.

396
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,517
Speaker 1: Start at the beginning, again back to zero,

397
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:19,976
Speaker 1: and again go back to zero.

398
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,297
Speaker 1: And only if there's a huge puncture in your

399
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:28,640
Speaker 1: ego, a huge spiritual wound of the best

400
00:24:28,681 --> 00:24:32,796
Speaker 1: kind, will you be able to keep letting go

401
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:38,351
Speaker 1: Because the ego says no, I'm important, I

402
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:43,952
Speaker 1: exist, I have my needs and the ego does

403
00:24:43,972 --> 00:24:44,254
Speaker 1: have its needs.

404
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,080
Speaker 1: Believe me, you all know that the ego has

405
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,885
Speaker 1: lots my needs and the ego does have its

406
00:24:45,905 --> 00:24:46,228
Speaker 1: needs, believe me.

407
00:24:46,248 --> 00:24:48,436
Speaker 1: You all know that the ego has lots of needs

408
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,435
Speaker 1: and the ego likes to be recognized and

409
00:24:51,495 --> 00:24:54,362
Speaker 1: loved and adored and respected.

410
00:24:58,171 --> 00:25:01,240
Speaker 1: But your true self doesn't need any of

411
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:07,289
Speaker 1: those things, doesn't need any of those

412
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:07,430
Speaker 1: things.

413
00:25:08,193 --> 00:25:10,893
Speaker 1: And you, whoever you are, have to make a

414
00:25:11,154 --> 00:25:12,218
Speaker 1: decision which way you're going to go.

415
00:25:13,772 --> 00:25:16,174
Speaker 1: At a certain point, we have to make a

416
00:25:16,194 --> 00:25:17,258
Speaker 1: decision which way we're going to go.

417
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,199
Speaker 1: Is it going to be living the life of the

418
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:23,827
Speaker 1: small self, being a prisoner of its endless

419
00:25:23,868 --> 00:25:26,198
Speaker 1: fears and endless desires and endless needs,

420
00:25:28,752 --> 00:25:31,217
Speaker 1: or are we going to get to that point that

421
00:25:31,258 --> 00:25:32,260
Speaker 1: few people actually do?

422
00:25:33,022 --> 00:25:33,623
Speaker 1: We get fed up.

423
00:25:35,851 --> 00:25:37,397
Speaker 1: We get fed up with being petty and being

424
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:40,595
Speaker 1: self-concerned, being small-minded and

425
00:25:40,615 --> 00:25:41,177
Speaker 1: being trapped.

426
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:48,654
Speaker 1: We want to be free Finally, once and for

427
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:48,815
Speaker 1: all.

428
00:25:48,835 --> 00:25:50,513
Speaker 1: We want to be free Finally, once and for

429
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:50,754
Speaker 1: all.

430
00:25:50,774 --> 00:25:51,898
Speaker 1: We want to truly be free.

431
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:56,357
Speaker 1: And then, and only then, we stop playing

432
00:25:56,397 --> 00:25:56,698
Speaker 1: games.

433
00:25:59,531 --> 00:26:02,455
Speaker 1: By playing games, I mean we think we still

434
00:26:02,475 --> 00:26:03,581
Speaker 1: have time to be less than serious.

435
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:04,667
Speaker 1: We think we still have time to be less than

436
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:05,150
Speaker 1: serious.

437
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:07,496
Speaker 1: We think we still have time to be less than

438
00:26:07,596 --> 00:26:08,520
Speaker 1: absolutely sincere.

439
00:26:10,731 --> 00:26:13,138
Speaker 1: We think we have time to be less than

440
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:14,221
Speaker 1: absolutely real.

441
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:19,536
Speaker 1: But when you get to that point that I'm

442
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:20,138
Speaker 1: speaking about.

443
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,413
Speaker 1: You want to stop playing games, you want it

444
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:26,954
Speaker 1: to be real and you're willing to face the

445
00:26:26,994 --> 00:26:28,179
Speaker 1: truth, whatever it is going to be.

446
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:42,080
Speaker 1: I remember when I was about 15.

447
00:26:43,851 --> 00:26:45,316
Speaker 1: It must have been 1970.

448
00:26:45,336 --> 00:26:47,344
Speaker 1: So I was born in 1955.

449
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,314
Speaker 1: And I was with some friends in the country

450
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,522
Speaker 1: Vermont, I think.

451
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:56,724
Speaker 1: In the country.

452
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,835
Speaker 1: We were in a single house in the country

453
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:04,533
Speaker 1: and we'd taken a huge amount of LSD Way too

454
00:27:04,553 --> 00:27:05,517
Speaker 1: much for such young people.

455
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,475
Speaker 1: That's what it was like in those days.

456
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:15,334
Speaker 1: And I remember I was in a very intoxicated

457
00:27:15,414 --> 00:27:23,093
Speaker 1: state of psychedelic awareness and one of

458
00:27:23,154 --> 00:27:28,072
Speaker 1: our friends came to visit us and this

459
00:27:28,392 --> 00:27:32,482
Speaker 1: particular fellow had not ingested the LSD

460
00:27:32,522 --> 00:27:34,196
Speaker 1: with us, so he was not in the altered state

461
00:27:34,216 --> 00:27:34,698
Speaker 1: that we were.

462
00:27:36,971 --> 00:27:39,580
Speaker 1: And this fellow had a particularly big ego.

463
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:45,658
Speaker 1: He was a very arrogant, overconfident

464
00:27:45,718 --> 00:27:46,299
Speaker 1: narcissist.

465
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,340
Speaker 1: And I remember looking at him as he came in

466
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,728
Speaker 1: and he was speaking to us and, under the

467
00:27:52,788 --> 00:27:58,419
Speaker 1: influence of the psychedelic substance, all

468
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:00,783
Speaker 1: I could see was his ego and it was so ugly

469
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,813
Speaker 1: I found it unbearable to look at him.

470
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:15,317
Speaker 1: It was terrifying, even frightening, and

471
00:28:15,337 --> 00:28:19,643
Speaker 1: that ugliness, pettiness and

472
00:28:19,683 --> 00:28:25,611
Speaker 1: small-mindedness and selfishness and

473
00:28:25,631 --> 00:28:30,316
Speaker 1: narcissism lives in all of us.

474
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,199
Speaker 1: And so when we get truly serious about

475
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:35,322
Speaker 1: waking up, if we ever do if we ever do,

476
00:28:35,362 --> 00:28:36,544
Speaker 1: because a lot of people are interested in

477
00:28:37,024 --> 00:28:46,581
Speaker 1: higher state experiences but they don't

478
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:47,804
Speaker 1: necessarily want to pay the price of ego

479
00:28:47,844 --> 00:28:48,786
Speaker 1: transcendence.

480
00:28:48,806 --> 00:28:50,009
Speaker 1: But when we get to that point if we ever do,

481
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:55,027
Speaker 1: we're willing to pay the price for ego

482
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:58,279
Speaker 1: transcendence we get serious and that's

483
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,686
Speaker 1: when you start living as if you're not

484
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:00,530
Speaker 1: going to get another chance.

485
00:29:02,718 --> 00:29:04,023
Speaker 1: You know that karma is real and that you

486
00:29:04,063 --> 00:29:05,087
Speaker 1: might not get another chance.

487
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:11,007
Speaker 1: Karma is real and we might not get another

488
00:29:11,027 --> 00:29:11,890
Speaker 1: chance in this life.

489
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,551
Speaker 1: So, while we want to be loving and kind and

490
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:20,215
Speaker 1: generous, compassionate and fun loving, but

491
00:29:20,235 --> 00:29:29,426
Speaker 1: there is this deep knowing that this is not

492
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:29,787
Speaker 1: a game.

493
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:38,586
Speaker 1: And I'm not trying to say that the human

494
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:40,453
Speaker 1: experience is not a game, because suffering

495
00:29:40,553 --> 00:29:42,619
Speaker 1: exists, as the Buddha pointed out to all of

496
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,032
Speaker 1: us so passionately, and in life there is

497
00:29:46,072 --> 00:29:46,473
Speaker 1: suffering.

498
00:29:47,015 --> 00:29:48,980
Speaker 1: So I'm not saying that life is not a game

499
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,914
Speaker 1: simply because of the truth of suffering,

500
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:54,545
Speaker 1: but I'm saying that life is not a game

501
00:29:54,566 --> 00:29:57,412
Speaker 1: because what's happening here, in this

502
00:29:57,472 --> 00:29:59,375
Speaker 1: experiment of consciousness and cognition

503
00:30:00,577 --> 00:30:02,680
Speaker 1: the emergence of consciousness and

504
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,925
Speaker 1: cognition in the universe, in the evolving

505
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:07,937
Speaker 1: universe is serious.

506
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:16,470
Speaker 1: In our deepest states of consciousness,

507
00:30:16,755 --> 00:30:19,463
Speaker 1: when we're experiencing our most profound

508
00:30:19,524 --> 00:30:20,410
Speaker 1: moments of revelation.

509
00:30:22,076 --> 00:30:23,079
Speaker 1: It's not a laughing matter.

510
00:30:26,263 --> 00:30:27,087
Speaker 1: These are moments of revelation.

511
00:30:27,107 --> 00:30:27,709
Speaker 1: It's not a laughing matter.

512
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:28,953
Speaker 1: These are moments of being absolutely

513
00:30:28,973 --> 00:30:29,997
Speaker 1: overwhelmed by how serious it is to be

514
00:30:30,057 --> 00:30:30,459
Speaker 1: alive.

515
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:36,537
Speaker 1: So it's almost like we're experiencing in

516
00:30:36,557 --> 00:30:36,898
Speaker 1: the very.

517
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,313
Speaker 1: We're becoming conscious of the very fabric

518
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:43,193
Speaker 1: of creation itself, which is not separate

519
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:44,872
Speaker 1: from our own self, which is not separate

520
00:30:44,892 --> 00:30:52,910
Speaker 1: from who we are, is deadly serious and

521
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,779
Speaker 1: there's so much joy in that seriousness.

522
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,879
Speaker 1: We become serious people, which means

523
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:01,801
Speaker 1: sincere people.

524
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,958
Speaker 1: We become very sincere because life is not

525
00:31:04,998 --> 00:31:06,242
Speaker 1: a game, life is not a joke.

526
00:31:07,671 --> 00:31:11,793
Speaker 1: There's so much to be done, so much

527
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:14,834
Speaker 1: consciousness is lacking, so many of us are

528
00:31:14,854 --> 00:31:15,497
Speaker 1: so lost.

529
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,312
Speaker 1: Every moment is important, really.

530
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,032
Speaker 1: So waking up to this absolute truth and

531
00:31:38,052 --> 00:31:40,216
Speaker 1: this absolute cognition and this absolute

532
00:31:40,235 --> 00:31:43,682
Speaker 1: knowing is truly waking up to what a

533
00:31:43,742 --> 00:31:47,371
Speaker 1: serious business it is to be alive, what a

534
00:31:47,432 --> 00:31:48,697
Speaker 1: huge responsibility it is.

535
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:54,137
Speaker 1: It's a big responsibility to become

536
00:31:54,197 --> 00:31:58,372
Speaker 1: conscious of consciousness, because when

537
00:31:58,393 --> 00:32:00,319
Speaker 1: you truly become conscious of consciousness,

538
00:32:02,413 --> 00:32:03,958
Speaker 1: to some degree at least, after that you

539
00:32:03,978 --> 00:32:09,797
Speaker 1: have to become an exemplar, because you

540
00:32:09,877 --> 00:32:12,831
Speaker 1: know and you see and you understand and you

541
00:32:12,871 --> 00:32:16,933
Speaker 1: recognize what this is all about, and after

542
00:32:16,973 --> 00:32:18,358
Speaker 1: that point you can't pretend that you don't

543
00:32:18,418 --> 00:32:18,700
Speaker 1: anymore.

544
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,815
Speaker 1: Especially if you have courage.

545
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,099
Speaker 1: You can't pretend that you don't,

546
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,252
Speaker 1: especially if you have courage, you can't

547
00:32:24,272 --> 00:32:26,335
Speaker 1: pretend that you don't.

548
00:32:26,355 --> 00:32:28,078
Speaker 1: Most people, because they're living in a

549
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:31,143
Speaker 1: small world and a small self, are afraid of

550
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,105
Speaker 1: too much reality.

551
00:32:35,196 --> 00:32:36,441
Speaker 1: They're afraid of too much consciousness,

552
00:32:36,461 --> 00:32:41,042
Speaker 1: they're afraid of the truth, without even

553
00:32:41,082 --> 00:32:42,448
Speaker 1: knowing what the truth is.

554
00:32:42,468 --> 00:32:45,957
Speaker 1: They're afraid of it Because it's

555
00:32:46,058 --> 00:32:47,646
Speaker 1: frightening for someone who's not prepared

556
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:47,787
Speaker 1: for it.

557
00:32:47,807 --> 00:32:50,508
Speaker 1: To wake up to see the truth, to see how big

558
00:32:50,528 --> 00:32:52,212
Speaker 1: this all is, to see how important this all

559
00:32:52,232 --> 00:32:55,159
Speaker 1: is, most people are scared to death of

560
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,991
Speaker 1: knowing that, of seeing it for themselves.

561
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:15,366
Speaker 1: So waking up is not something that the ego

562
00:33:15,386 --> 00:33:17,991
Speaker 1: does for its entertainment, even though

563
00:33:18,011 --> 00:33:20,279
Speaker 1: that seems like a lot of people are up to.

564
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:23,177
Speaker 1: It's like taking on a completely different

565
00:33:23,217 --> 00:33:23,759
Speaker 1: vocation.

566
00:33:26,953 --> 00:33:28,779
Speaker 1: I thought the human experience was about me,

567
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,080
Speaker 1: satisfying my desires and meeting my needs,

568
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,275
Speaker 1: and you realize, no, it never was.

569
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:39,934
Speaker 1: Never was about you, never was about any of

570
00:33:39,995 --> 00:33:40,075
Speaker 1: us.

571
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,476
Speaker 1: It's about reality itself.

572
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,534
Speaker 1: It's about reality itself.

573
00:33:45,554 --> 00:33:46,116
Speaker 1: It's about reality itself.

574
00:33:46,136 --> 00:33:47,099
Speaker 1: It's not about me, it's not about you.

575
00:34:04,531 --> 00:34:06,317
Speaker 1: So to be serious about this means that we

576
00:34:06,397 --> 00:34:11,401
Speaker 1: need to make sure that we can awaken, as

577
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:12,693
Speaker 1: I've been saying, that we can awaken and

578
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:14,659
Speaker 1: reawaken and reawaken on a regular basis.

579
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:18,977
Speaker 1: A lot of people speak about experiences

580
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:21,758
Speaker 1: that they had a long time ago.

581
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,017
Speaker 1: And the first thing that my teacher told me

582
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:31,373
Speaker 1: when I met him in 1986, was that a memory,

583
00:34:32,435 --> 00:34:35,330
Speaker 1: a beautiful memory of absolute reality is

584
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,856
Speaker 1: not absolute reality, it's a memory.

585
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:41,215
Speaker 1: It's like looking at a photograph If you

586
00:34:41,255 --> 00:34:43,180
Speaker 1: were in love, if you were madly in love

587
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,843
Speaker 1: with somebody when you were 17 or 18, and

588
00:34:44,768 --> 00:34:45,254
Speaker 1: you have in love, if you were madly in love

589
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,387
Speaker 1: with somebody when you were 17 or 18, and

590
00:34:47,407 --> 00:34:51,139
Speaker 1: you have a photograph of yourself and

591
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:58,920
Speaker 1: whoever it was, that photograph contains a

592
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,790
Speaker 1: mere fraction of what your inner experience

593
00:35:01,953 --> 00:35:04,541
Speaker 1: actually was at that time.

594
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:09,051
Speaker 1: So memories of non-dual experiences are not

595
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:10,517
Speaker 1: non-dual consciousness itself.

596
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:17,391
Speaker 1: And my guru made clear to me that hanging

597
00:35:17,452 --> 00:35:22,615
Speaker 1: on to memories of absolute reality tie us

598
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:28,058
Speaker 1: to, they keep us chained to the mind, and

599
00:35:28,078 --> 00:35:29,822
Speaker 1: what he told me that I needed to do is, if

600
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:31,052
Speaker 1: I wanted to wake up to enlightened

601
00:35:31,112 --> 00:35:32,276
Speaker 1: awareness, I needed to let go of my

602
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,359
Speaker 1: attachment to the memory of what had

603
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:37,718
Speaker 1: happened to me when I was younger, and I

604
00:35:37,758 --> 00:35:37,999
Speaker 1: was so.

605
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:40,060
Speaker 1: I was very attached to that experience.

606
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:41,507
Speaker 1: That experience was the source of my

607
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:42,090
Speaker 1: inspiration.

608
00:35:42,251 --> 00:35:45,540
Speaker 1: He told me to let it go and without without

609
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:45,962
Speaker 1: that experience.

610
00:35:45,982 --> 00:35:47,106
Speaker 1: That experience was the source of my

611
00:35:47,127 --> 00:35:47,388
Speaker 1: inspiration.

612
00:35:47,408 --> 00:35:49,462
Speaker 1: It taught me to let it go, and without that

613
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:50,309
Speaker 1: experience I really had nothing anymore.

614
00:35:51,571 --> 00:35:56,238
Speaker 1: But I did it and that changed everything.

615
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,222
Speaker 1: So we always have to start at the beginning

616
00:35:59,302 --> 00:36:00,885
Speaker 1: every day, back to zero.

617
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,718
Speaker 1: Zero is the jumping off point to everything,

618
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:16,712
Speaker 1: like taking a bath or a shower Every day,

619
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:19,100
Speaker 1: going back to zero, starting all over again,

620
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,151
Speaker 1: if we can.

621
00:36:34,482 --> 00:36:35,683
Speaker 1: So this talk is supposed to be about the

622
00:36:35,703 --> 00:36:39,867
Speaker 1: evolution of non-duality, and I've often

623
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:50,235
Speaker 1: spoken about that and I will now speak

624
00:36:50,255 --> 00:36:50,678
Speaker 1: about it a little bit.

625
00:36:50,698 --> 00:36:55,059
Speaker 1: So the Sorry, andrew, that I interrupt you.

626
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,253
Speaker 1: Your microphone is scratching a little bit

627
00:36:57,334 --> 00:37:13,972
Speaker 1: at your collar here Up here, yeah, and it

628
00:37:13,992 --> 00:37:14,472
Speaker 1: makes a sound.

629
00:37:14,552 --> 00:37:15,153
Speaker 1: The microphone makes a sound.

630
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:17,635
Speaker 1: So sorry about that, thank you.

631
00:37:20,678 --> 00:37:22,940
Speaker 1: So, in terms of the evolution of

632
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,565
Speaker 1: non-duality, we get into some very

633
00:37:30,726 --> 00:37:31,687
Speaker 1: interesting territory.

634
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,912
Speaker 1: Because when we think about the whole

635
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:38,801
Speaker 1: notion of oneness, when you think, and then

636
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:40,824
Speaker 1: again, this is all, we're using the mind

637
00:37:40,964 --> 00:37:45,132
Speaker 1: here, this is the we're using the mind here.

638
00:37:45,152 --> 00:37:46,314
Speaker 1: So this all gets very deceptive and very

639
00:37:46,334 --> 00:37:46,514
Speaker 1: confusing.

640
00:37:46,534 --> 00:37:49,219
Speaker 1: But when you think about oneness, it's not

641
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:52,765
Speaker 1: oneness, because oneness can't be seen.

642
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,794
Speaker 1: So many of you have heard me tell the story

643
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:09,159
Speaker 1: about my guru who, before he met his own

644
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,576
Speaker 1: guru, the great Ramana Maharshi was a

645
00:38:12,616 --> 00:38:13,378
Speaker 1: Krishna Bhakta.

646
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:22,017
Speaker 1: He was a devotee of Krishna and his own

647
00:38:22,037 --> 00:38:23,660
Speaker 1: devotional practice had reached such a high

648
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,966
Speaker 1: level, after being very focused on it for

649
00:38:26,986 --> 00:38:29,550
Speaker 1: many years, that he had visions of Krishna

650
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:31,337
Speaker 1: coming alive before him and speaking to him.

651
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,675
Speaker 1: So that's a very high level of

652
00:38:33,736 --> 00:38:34,418
Speaker 1: concentration.

653
00:38:35,611 --> 00:38:42,511
Speaker 1: So he had visions of Krishna, of God, but

654
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:43,614
Speaker 1: he had a sense that there was more.

655
00:38:43,674 --> 00:38:48,514
Speaker 1: So at a certain point in his life he

656
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:53,695
Speaker 1: started traveling around India, going to

657
00:38:53,735 --> 00:38:55,280
Speaker 1: see all the most famous gurus at the time

658
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,514
Speaker 1: and this would have been the late forties

659
00:38:58,339 --> 00:38:59,675
Speaker 1: telling them can you help me see God?

660
00:39:01,711 --> 00:39:03,295
Speaker 1: And he said every all the gurus he went to

661
00:39:03,355 --> 00:39:05,321
Speaker 1: said yes, I can do this technique, do this

662
00:39:05,361 --> 00:39:09,461
Speaker 1: method, practice this kind of approach.

663
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:13,136
Speaker 1: And he wanted, he was looking for someone

664
00:39:13,156 --> 00:39:16,459
Speaker 1: who could show him directly God.

665
00:39:17,113 --> 00:39:19,657
Speaker 1: So, apparently, when he asked Ramana the

666
00:39:19,677 --> 00:39:22,898
Speaker 1: question can you show me God?

667
00:39:23,038 --> 00:39:25,154
Speaker 1: Ramana said no, I can't because God is the

668
00:39:25,215 --> 00:39:25,536
Speaker 1: seer.

669
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:33,177
Speaker 1: So if God is the seer, then me.

670
00:39:33,217 --> 00:39:36,413
Speaker 1: That's very profound, everyone knew it's

671
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:36,936
Speaker 1: very profound.

672
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,799
Speaker 1: So that means that right now, as you're

673
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:41,653
Speaker 1: looking at me and I'm looking at all of you,

674
00:39:43,337 --> 00:39:47,328
Speaker 1: the seer is who and what.

675
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:49,436
Speaker 1: The absolute principle or the Godhead is.

676
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:55,031
Speaker 1: The Godhead is the seer right now, and

677
00:39:55,051 --> 00:39:57,675
Speaker 1: either that's obvious to you or it's not

678
00:39:57,755 --> 00:40:00,995
Speaker 1: obvious to you, but whether it's obvious or

679
00:40:01,055 --> 00:40:01,678
Speaker 1: not, it's true.

680
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:08,594
Speaker 1: So the seer, not the seen, is what God, or

681
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,099
Speaker 1: the absolute principle of the Godhead

682
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:13,197
Speaker 1: actually is the seer, not the seen.

683
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,355
Speaker 1: Now, if you're very identified with your

684
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:23,294
Speaker 1: small self and your ego, you'll just be

685
00:40:23,414 --> 00:40:35,512
Speaker 1: seeing your ego paying attention to the

686
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:35,953
Speaker 1: experience of seeing.

687
00:40:35,973 --> 00:40:37,274
Speaker 1: But in the higher and deeper states of

688
00:40:37,315 --> 00:40:42,341
Speaker 1: awakened awareness, you can directly

689
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:50,459
Speaker 1: experience, even in your own self, but the

690
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:58,814
Speaker 1: small self disappears and it's possible to

691
00:40:58,854 --> 00:41:00,019
Speaker 1: have that kind of experience.

692
00:41:00,693 --> 00:41:07,724
Speaker 1: Believe me, that the annoying presence, the

693
00:41:07,744 --> 00:41:10,211
Speaker 1: annoying presence of the fears and desires

694
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:12,836
Speaker 1: of the small self and its consciousness of

695
00:41:12,896 --> 00:41:16,924
Speaker 1: itself can at times, in higher states of

696
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,575
Speaker 1: consciousness and cognition, completely

697
00:41:18,615 --> 00:41:21,102
Speaker 1: disappear and vanish from your awareness.

698
00:41:25,095 --> 00:41:26,510
Speaker 1: So then you're not just aware of awareness,

699
00:41:26,891 --> 00:41:28,457
Speaker 1: or it's not just the consciousness of

700
00:41:28,497 --> 00:41:33,759
Speaker 1: consciousness, but there's an awareness in

701
00:41:33,799 --> 00:41:35,586
Speaker 1: which this non-relative, our absolute

702
00:41:35,606 --> 00:41:39,351
Speaker 1: principle is bearing witness to itself in

703
00:41:39,411 --> 00:41:42,731
Speaker 1: all its inconceivable glory, all its

704
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:47,760
Speaker 1: inconceivable glory.

705
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,403
Speaker 1: It's not just a moment of quiet, seeing

706
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:56,682
Speaker 1: where the mind is, it's not just a moment

707
00:41:56,702 --> 00:41:57,664
Speaker 1: of seeing when the mind is quiet, but it's

708
00:41:57,704 --> 00:42:07,581
Speaker 1: a revelation, it's the experience of

709
00:42:07,601 --> 00:42:08,442
Speaker 1: revelation of this absolute principle.

710
00:42:08,462 --> 00:42:09,644
Speaker 1: So this is to repeat something I've been

711
00:42:09,664 --> 00:42:11,190
Speaker 1: saying ever since I started to talk today,

712
00:42:11,971 --> 00:42:14,113
Speaker 1: it's the mysterious cognition of everything

713
00:42:14,153 --> 00:42:16,815
Speaker 1: and nothing simultaneously.

714
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:29,566
Speaker 1: How can I see and know everything and

715
00:42:29,606 --> 00:42:30,527
Speaker 1: nothing at the same time?

716
00:42:33,698 --> 00:42:37,217
Speaker 1: You can't understand it with the mind, but

717
00:42:37,237 --> 00:42:38,523
Speaker 1: you can know everything and nothing at the

718
00:42:38,543 --> 00:42:41,633
Speaker 1: same time If you're willing to let go of

719
00:42:41,654 --> 00:42:42,315
Speaker 1: this and that and the.

720
00:42:48,924 --> 00:42:56,220
Speaker 1: The presence and consciousness and

721
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:03,261
Speaker 1: cognition of the absolute transports us

722
00:43:03,301 --> 00:43:04,604
Speaker 1: into another dimension of knowing.

723
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,154
Speaker 1: It's when the seer, which is God, the

724
00:43:15,234 --> 00:43:22,283
Speaker 1: absolute principle, is being seen by who?

725
00:43:24,466 --> 00:43:27,116
Speaker 1: By you, but the you that's doing the seeing

726
00:43:27,136 --> 00:43:28,340
Speaker 1: at that point is not your ego.

727
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,511
Speaker 1: That's what changes everything.

728
00:43:52,288 --> 00:43:54,509
Speaker 1: So the evolving dimension of all this is

729
00:43:54,569 --> 00:44:00,762
Speaker 1: very interesting because the universe, the

730
00:44:00,802 --> 00:44:04,997
Speaker 1: evolving universe, the creative process

731
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:05,882
Speaker 1: that we call the evolving universe, the

732
00:44:05,902 --> 00:44:06,666
Speaker 1: evolving universe, the creative process

733
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:08,874
Speaker 1: that we call the evolving universe, all of

734
00:44:08,935 --> 00:44:10,359
Speaker 1: time and space and everything that exists

735
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:15,758
Speaker 1: within it and that which transcends time

736
00:44:15,798 --> 00:44:17,301
Speaker 1: and space and everything that exists within

737
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:28,438
Speaker 1: it, is not static, is not static Sum total

738
00:44:28,478 --> 00:44:30,662
Speaker 1: of all of reality, everything that is seen

739
00:44:30,722 --> 00:44:36,580
Speaker 1: and unseen, known and unknown, all manifest

740
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:44,047
Speaker 1: and unmanifest reality, is not static.

741
00:44:46,278 --> 00:44:48,728
Speaker 1: The unmanifest and the manifest are one and

742
00:44:48,748 --> 00:44:48,889
Speaker 1: not two.

743
00:44:49,851 --> 00:44:52,118
Speaker 1: Manifest reality and unmanifest reality are

744
00:44:52,178 --> 00:44:52,700
Speaker 1: one and not two.

745
00:44:55,391 --> 00:44:58,292
Speaker 1: Whereas unmanifest reality is static and

746
00:44:58,392 --> 00:45:01,535
Speaker 1: unmoving and infinite and timeless and

747
00:45:01,595 --> 00:45:03,200
Speaker 1: formless and beginningless and endless and

748
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,936
Speaker 1: eternal, manifest reality is not static.

749
00:45:09,182 --> 00:45:11,549
Speaker 1: Manifest reality is not a journey of

750
00:45:11,569 --> 00:45:11,850
Speaker 1: becoming.

751
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:14,958
Speaker 1: It's the evolving universe, it's the

752
00:45:15,018 --> 00:45:16,903
Speaker 1: universe of time and space and form.

753
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:21,775
Speaker 1: And manifest reality is an evolutionary

754
00:45:21,835 --> 00:45:25,260
Speaker 1: process that's in a state of becoming more

755
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:27,945
Speaker 1: complex over time.

756
00:45:30,131 --> 00:45:32,500
Speaker 1: It's on a journey of becoming.

757
00:45:38,391 --> 00:45:40,258
Speaker 1: So the manifest and the unmanifest are one

758
00:45:40,278 --> 00:45:40,779
Speaker 1: and not two.

759
00:45:44,591 --> 00:45:48,038
Speaker 1: Just like this, as they say in the Buddha

760
00:45:48,058 --> 00:45:50,156
Speaker 1: Dharma, form is emptiness and emptiness is

761
00:45:50,216 --> 00:45:50,477
Speaker 1: form.

762
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:53,137
Speaker 1: Manifest reality and unmanifest reality are

763
00:45:53,198 --> 00:45:55,205
Speaker 1: one and not two, which means the same thing,

764
00:45:55,266 --> 00:45:56,956
Speaker 1: as form is emptiness and emptiness is form.

765
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:01,177
Speaker 1: But, as the great Ken Wilber is fond of

766
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,735
Speaker 1: saying, yes, form is emptiness and

767
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,538
Speaker 1: emptiness is form.

768
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:07,580
Speaker 1: But the world of form is also evolving.

769
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:15,997
Speaker 1: So the manifest and the unmanifest are one

770
00:46:16,038 --> 00:46:16,479
Speaker 1: and not two.

771
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,097
Speaker 1: Unmanifest reality is static.

772
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:23,710
Speaker 1: Manifest reality is evolving.

773
00:46:28,817 --> 00:46:29,798
Speaker 1: Unmanifest reality is static.

774
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:30,640
Speaker 1: Manifest reality is evolving.

775
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,262
Speaker 1: So if we want to look at the sum totality

776
00:46:32,302 --> 00:46:33,744
Speaker 1: of everything that exists and everything

777
00:46:33,764 --> 00:46:40,294
Speaker 1: that doesn't exist, from an absolute

778
00:46:40,314 --> 00:46:41,239
Speaker 1: perspective, we can no longer distinguish

779
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:49,245
Speaker 1: between manifest and unmanifest, because

780
00:46:49,385 --> 00:46:51,330
Speaker 1: manifest and unmanifest are one and not two.

781
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,715
Speaker 1: So because the manifest and the unmanifest

782
00:46:53,836 --> 00:46:54,838
Speaker 1: are one and not two, because the manifest

783
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:59,151
Speaker 1: is indeed part of an evolving developing

784
00:46:59,171 --> 00:47:01,421
Speaker 1: process in a state of becoming, and we

785
00:47:01,482 --> 00:47:03,270
Speaker 1: realize that from a non-dual perspective,

786
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:04,796
Speaker 1: where the manifest and the unmanifest and

787
00:47:04,856 --> 00:47:05,378
Speaker 1: we're not two.

788
00:47:07,316 --> 00:47:11,436
Speaker 1: The reality as a whole is not static but is

789
00:47:11,477 --> 00:47:17,440
Speaker 1: in a state of becoming and, to use

790
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:20,657
Speaker 1: religious, mythic language, it's fun

791
00:47:21,353 --> 00:47:24,159
Speaker 1: because then we get to make statements like

792
00:47:24,873 --> 00:47:26,560
Speaker 1: God if God.

793
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,708
Speaker 1: It's fun because then we get to make

794
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:34,839
Speaker 1: statements like God if God means which is a

795
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:36,203
Speaker 1: mythic term if we use the word God to mean

796
00:47:36,243 --> 00:47:36,925
Speaker 1: the sum total.

797
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:38,954
Speaker 1: God is the sum totality of everything that

798
00:47:38,974 --> 00:47:42,229
Speaker 1: exists and everything that doesn't exist.

799
00:47:43,433 --> 00:47:44,966
Speaker 1: When we start, when we introduce some new

800
00:47:45,006 --> 00:47:49,578
Speaker 1: information which tells us that that god is

801
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:56,199
Speaker 1: actually evolving, you say what god is

802
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:56,780
Speaker 1: evolving?

803
00:47:57,702 --> 00:48:02,240
Speaker 1: Wow, the sum totality of everything that

804
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,677
Speaker 1: exists and everything that doesn't exist is

805
00:48:04,737 --> 00:48:08,598
Speaker 1: on a developmental journey of becoming more

806
00:48:10,837 --> 00:48:11,720
Speaker 1: of what it can be.

807
00:48:14,233 --> 00:48:16,247
Speaker 1: And then, to explore the meaning and

808
00:48:16,267 --> 00:48:17,944
Speaker 1: significance of non-duality a little bit

809
00:48:17,985 --> 00:48:20,397
Speaker 1: more deeply, we realize that I am and you

810
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:24,400
Speaker 1: are not separate from that one, which is

811
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:33,238
Speaker 1: not two, as Vedanta tells us.

812
00:48:33,479 --> 00:48:34,874
Speaker 1: I am, that the ultimate truth about the

813
00:48:34,914 --> 00:48:36,692
Speaker 1: nature of reality in Vedanta is that I am,

814
00:48:36,732 --> 00:48:39,775
Speaker 1: that I am the only one that there is.

815
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:43,290
Speaker 1: There's only one, I, in the universe, and

816
00:48:43,371 --> 00:48:45,156
Speaker 1: you and I and all of us are that one I,

817
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:56,437
Speaker 1: without a second, and that one I is

818
00:48:56,497 --> 00:49:07,625
Speaker 1: evolving and you and I are not separate

819
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:11,768
Speaker 1: from that process of becoming, of absolute

820
00:49:11,808 --> 00:49:12,228
Speaker 1: becoming.

821
00:49:18,072 --> 00:49:19,036
Speaker 1: So where does that leave us?

822
00:49:21,412 --> 00:49:22,417
Speaker 1: Neither here or there.

823
00:49:29,626 --> 00:49:30,347
Speaker 1: Neither here or there.

824
00:49:31,334 --> 00:49:36,920
Speaker 1: When you realize that God is becoming, that

825
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:44,124
Speaker 1: she's on a journey of becoming, then it

826
00:49:44,225 --> 00:49:45,609
Speaker 1: includes everything and excludes nothing,

827
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:50,372
Speaker 1: the deepest interior dimension of which is

828
00:49:50,392 --> 00:49:51,134
Speaker 1: your own deepest states of subjective

829
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:51,334
Speaker 1: awareness.

830
00:49:51,354 --> 00:49:52,938
Speaker 1: This whole experience of being human

831
00:49:53,299 --> 00:49:54,982
Speaker 1: becomes very interesting, much more

832
00:49:55,002 --> 00:49:59,396
Speaker 1: interesting than we usually is, because

833
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:00,958
Speaker 1: when you really wake up, you begin to not

834
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:02,781
Speaker 1: only understand these things with your mind,

835
00:50:02,821 --> 00:50:10,501
Speaker 1: but feel these things with your soul, and

836
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:13,759
Speaker 1: you can become so enthralled in the

837
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:20,380
Speaker 1: interdimensional complexity of this process

838
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,990
Speaker 1: that you can forget delightfully the

839
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:27,407
Speaker 1: narrative of your, of this process, that

840
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:28,515
Speaker 1: you can forget delightfully the narrative

841
00:50:28,535 --> 00:50:29,407
Speaker 1: of your small self, because you become so

842
00:50:29,428 --> 00:50:31,435
Speaker 1: consumed with this cosmic, centric

843
00:50:31,455 --> 00:50:34,031
Speaker 1: perspective on your own identity and on the

844
00:50:34,051 --> 00:50:35,216
Speaker 1: nature of reality itself.

845
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:45,835
Speaker 1: So, to repeat and this is difficult stuff,

846
00:50:45,895 --> 00:50:50,523
Speaker 1: I understand that absolute reality itself

847
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,032
Speaker 1: is evolving.

848
00:50:57,491 --> 00:51:00,336
Speaker 1: So, in our attempt to actually understand

849
00:51:00,356 --> 00:51:07,630
Speaker 1: the meaning of non-duality in 2021, the

850
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:09,658
Speaker 1: most interesting part of the understanding,

851
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,797
Speaker 1: the emerging understanding of non-duality

852
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:16,151
Speaker 1: is that non-duality itself, which is

853
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:20,933
Speaker 1: absolute oneness and not-to-ness, is not

854
00:51:20,973 --> 00:51:25,303
Speaker 1: static but is an evolving process itself

855
00:51:27,612 --> 00:51:28,456
Speaker 1: and it's absolute.

856
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,377
Speaker 1: And you and I are not in any way separate

857
00:51:31,398 --> 00:51:33,364
Speaker 1: from and we're not separate from this

858
00:51:33,446 --> 00:51:35,176
Speaker 1: process, not just at a biological level,

859
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,400
Speaker 1: but at the levels of our deepest

860
00:51:38,788 --> 00:51:42,871
Speaker 1: experiences of subjective awareness, our

861
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:43,758
Speaker 1: deepest felt and recognized experience of

862
00:51:43,779 --> 00:51:44,606
Speaker 1: conscious awareness, our deepest felt and

863
00:51:44,626 --> 00:51:46,133
Speaker 1: recognized experience of conscious

864
00:51:47,919 --> 00:51:48,420
Speaker 1: awareness.

865
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,657
Speaker 1: The consciousness of consciousness itself

866
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:57,270
Speaker 1: is not happening in a static context, but

867
00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:00,139
Speaker 1: it's happening in an evolving context.

868
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:05,557
Speaker 1: And it gets even more interesting when you

869
00:52:05,617 --> 00:52:10,701
Speaker 1: realize that the seer, the one who is

870
00:52:10,782 --> 00:52:14,230
Speaker 1: seeing the evolutionary process itself from

871
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:17,790
Speaker 1: the steepest place of interiority, is the

872
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:19,731
Speaker 1: absolute itself as you.

873
00:52:25,694 --> 00:52:27,415
Speaker 1: How much more interesting than that can it

874
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:27,755
Speaker 1: become?

875
00:52:33,357 --> 00:52:34,738
Speaker 1: So you have to be God to know.

876
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:50,145
Speaker 1: As you can see, there's no relief in this

877
00:52:50,165 --> 00:52:50,926
Speaker 1: kind of awakening.

878
00:52:52,327 --> 00:52:55,728
Speaker 1: There's no relief because it's unbearable.

879
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:01,219
Speaker 1: Too much consciousness, too absolute, too

880
00:53:01,299 --> 00:53:05,079
Speaker 1: overwhelming, too much truth.

881
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:11,840
Speaker 1: It too much truth, it's unbearable.

882
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,923
Speaker 1: It may be ecstatic and it may be liberating,

883
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,513
Speaker 1: but it's also unbearable because it's so

884
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:22,021
Speaker 1: much truth to bear without being crushed by

885
00:53:22,081 --> 00:53:22,141
Speaker 1: it.

886
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:26,233
Speaker 1: So I am.

887
00:53:26,273 --> 00:53:30,418
Speaker 1: That is no longer a safe place, because the

888
00:53:30,459 --> 00:53:32,788
Speaker 1: that that I am in this new evolutionary

889
00:53:32,848 --> 00:53:37,492
Speaker 1: context is in a state of becoming so.

890
00:53:37,512 --> 00:53:38,758
Speaker 1: The train has not stopped moving.

891
00:53:40,892 --> 00:53:46,595
Speaker 1: It's moving forward and in our deepest

892
00:53:46,676 --> 00:53:48,471
Speaker 1: moments of higher consciousness, we realize

893
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:50,216
Speaker 1: that who's at the wheel?

894
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:58,238
Speaker 1: You are Not as your small self, of course,

895
00:54:02,037 --> 00:54:03,902
Speaker 1: but as the true self, as the authentic self,

896
00:54:05,854 --> 00:54:06,997
Speaker 1: as the one without a second.

897
00:54:07,699 --> 00:54:08,281
Speaker 1: It's only you.

898
00:54:10,131 --> 00:54:12,892
Speaker 1: You've been there the whole time, you just

899
00:54:12,912 --> 00:54:13,615
Speaker 1: didn't realize it.

900
00:54:19,571 --> 00:54:21,398
Speaker 1: So form is emptiness and emptiness is form,

901
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:22,917
Speaker 1: and the world of form is evolving.

902
00:54:26,911 --> 00:54:31,052
Speaker 1: Try to remember that every day, form is

903
00:54:31,092 --> 00:54:32,634
Speaker 1: emptiness and emptiness is form, and the

904
00:54:32,655 --> 00:54:36,518
Speaker 1: world of form is evolving in the context of

905
00:54:36,558 --> 00:54:40,086
Speaker 1: the two truth doctrine, which tells us that

906
00:54:40,106 --> 00:54:41,513
Speaker 1: there's a distinction between relative

907
00:54:41,553 --> 00:54:43,039
Speaker 1: reality and absolute reality.

908
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:53,503
Speaker 1: Relative reality is real, it's real, but

909
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:54,789
Speaker 1: it's only relatively real.

910
00:54:55,819 --> 00:55:03,045
Speaker 1: And absolute reality is real, but it's

911
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:03,807
Speaker 1: absolutely real.

912
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:13,832
Speaker 1: So that which is absolutely real exists on

913
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:14,874
Speaker 1: a completely different level of

914
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:15,576
Speaker 1: significance in the context of a

915
00:55:15,596 --> 00:55:17,860
Speaker 1: hierarchical perspective and orientation.

916
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,213
Speaker 1: Absolute reality is more real.

917
00:55:22,516 --> 00:55:24,160
Speaker 1: Therefore, it's more significant for you

918
00:55:24,742 --> 00:55:25,163
Speaker 1: and for me.

919
00:55:59,695 --> 00:56:02,216
Speaker 1: So the absolute reality is the sum total of

920
00:56:02,256 --> 00:56:03,637
Speaker 1: everything that exists and everything that

921
00:56:03,657 --> 00:56:04,278
Speaker 1: doesn't exist.

922
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,287
Speaker 1: All of unmanifest and manifest reality are

923
00:56:07,347 --> 00:56:07,929
Speaker 1: one and not two.

924
00:56:10,821 --> 00:56:12,285
Speaker 1: All of manifest reality are.

925
00:56:12,505 --> 00:56:14,711
Speaker 1: All of manifest and unmanifest reality are

926
00:56:14,731 --> 00:56:15,272
Speaker 1: one and not two.

927
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,587
Speaker 1: Form is emptiness and emptiness is form.

928
00:56:31,607 --> 00:56:33,014
Speaker 1: But the world of form, which means manifest

929
00:56:33,034 --> 00:56:39,984
Speaker 1: reality, is evolving, which means that the

930
00:56:40,004 --> 00:56:40,810
Speaker 1: energy and intelligence that created the

931
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:41,637
Speaker 1: universe, which is the absolute principle,

932
00:56:41,657 --> 00:56:47,054
Speaker 1: which is the Godhead, is in a process of

933
00:56:47,094 --> 00:56:47,455
Speaker 1: becoming.

934
00:56:51,526 --> 00:56:52,729
Speaker 1: It's not just the universe itself, it's in

935
00:56:52,769 --> 00:56:56,780
Speaker 1: a state of becoming evolutionary, becoming.

936
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,307
Speaker 1: The energy and intelligence that gave rise

937
00:56:58,328 --> 00:57:01,007
Speaker 1: to the evolving universe is not separate

938
00:57:01,027 --> 00:57:03,288
Speaker 1: from it and is therefore also evolving,

939
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:08,522
Speaker 1: which means the mind of God, or mind of the

940
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:11,187
Speaker 1: creative principle is also in the process

941
00:57:11,247 --> 00:57:14,574
Speaker 1: of becoming more complex.

942
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:29,275
Speaker 1: If this is true and it sure seems to me

943
00:57:29,295 --> 00:57:38,158
Speaker 1: that it is this means that we have a lot of

944
00:57:38,178 --> 00:57:38,720
Speaker 1: catching up to do.

945
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,764
Speaker 1: Catching up means realizing all these

946
00:57:40,784 --> 00:57:42,631
Speaker 1: things for ourselves and then endeavoring

947
00:57:43,413 --> 00:57:45,180
Speaker 1: with great humility to take responsibility

948
00:57:45,881 --> 00:57:49,208
Speaker 1: for the implications of what it means to be

949
00:57:49,228 --> 00:57:51,873
Speaker 1: a conscious human being who's aware of the

950
00:57:51,933 --> 00:58:07,907
Speaker 1: absolute truth I am.

951
00:58:07,967 --> 00:58:09,391
Speaker 1: That, in fact, doesn't make life easier.

952
00:58:11,326 --> 00:58:20,661
Speaker 1: It makes life a lot harder, but only for

953
00:58:20,701 --> 00:58:21,202
Speaker 1: good reasons.

954
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,663
Speaker 1: So as this absolute, as the conscious

955
00:58:39,703 --> 00:58:41,265
Speaker 1: awareness of this absolute principle

956
00:58:41,306 --> 00:58:48,723
Speaker 1: emerges in our conscious experience, as

957
00:58:48,763 --> 00:58:49,806
Speaker 1: I've been saying in different ways,

958
00:58:49,866 --> 00:58:50,909
Speaker 1: everything else falls away.

959
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:52,272
Speaker 1: There's only that.

960
00:58:54,342 --> 00:58:59,346
Speaker 1: There's only that the small self is nowhere

961
00:58:59,366 --> 00:58:59,968
Speaker 1: to be seen.

962
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:03,623
Speaker 1: Its dramas and its stories is nowhere to be

963
00:59:03,644 --> 00:59:03,724
Speaker 1: seen.

964
00:59:03,784 --> 00:59:06,312
Speaker 1: Its dramas and its stories is nowhere to be

965
00:59:06,392 --> 00:59:06,673
Speaker 1: seen.

966
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,946
Speaker 1: When you awaken to absolute reality, deeply

967
00:59:12,247 --> 00:59:13,010
Speaker 1: and profoundly.

968
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:19,920
Speaker 1: Relative reality begins to disappear per

969
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,281
Speaker 1: time.

970
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:36,516
Speaker 1: So if the awakening to enlightened

971
00:59:36,576 --> 00:59:45,890
Speaker 1: awareness tells us that we are God or the

972
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:46,733
Speaker 1: absolute principle, if that's the

973
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:53,933
Speaker 1: revelation, I am that, and now we've come

974
00:59:53,953 --> 00:59:54,776
Speaker 1: to understand that that is evolving.

975
00:59:59,173 --> 01:00:01,059
Speaker 1: That's what the evolution of non-duality

976
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:01,179
Speaker 1: means.

977
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:05,205
Speaker 1: And of course, it is an absolutely

978
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,091
Speaker 1: soul-expanding revelation to begin to

979
01:00:06,111 --> 01:00:07,480
Speaker 1: cognize that, to begin to recognize it, to

980
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,207
Speaker 1: begin to directly experience the truth of

981
01:00:09,307 --> 01:00:09,348
Speaker 1: it.

982
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,548
Speaker 1: And, as I was just saying, what's even a

983
01:00:13,588 --> 01:00:16,727
Speaker 1: bigger challenge is to endeavor to take

984
01:00:16,747 --> 01:00:18,371
Speaker 1: responsibility for what that might mean

985
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,841
Speaker 1: about being a conscious human being who

986
01:00:22,901 --> 01:00:25,329
Speaker 1: knows these things, who's aware of it.

987
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,446
Speaker 1: I think the great Sri Aurobindo called it

988
01:00:31,546 --> 01:00:33,401
Speaker 1: being a, referred to as being a Gnostic

989
01:00:33,461 --> 01:00:33,821
Speaker 1: being.

990
01:01:02,195 --> 01:01:04,336
Speaker 1: So, relative reality, which is only half

991
01:01:04,356 --> 01:01:05,777
Speaker 1: the picture, a part of the picture, is

992
01:01:05,817 --> 01:01:06,277
Speaker 1: important.

993
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:10,004
Speaker 1: The domain and dominion of the relatively

994
01:01:10,064 --> 01:01:11,628
Speaker 1: real is important.

995
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,903
Speaker 1: It's a big part of the picture of what's

996
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:16,865
Speaker 1: true and what's real.

997
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:30,341
Speaker 1: Relative reality is real, but when you

998
01:01:30,361 --> 01:01:31,525
Speaker 1: awaken to absolute reality and become

999
01:01:31,585 --> 01:01:37,428
Speaker 1: conscious of absolute reality, that which

1000
01:01:37,508 --> 01:01:40,124
Speaker 1: is merely relatively real becomes less

1001
01:01:40,164 --> 01:01:42,401
Speaker 1: important to us, plays less of a role in

1002
01:01:42,461 --> 01:02:21,084
Speaker 1: our lives, and that's the whole point.

1003
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:22,627
Speaker 1: So when my relative identity and its story

1004
01:02:22,667 --> 01:02:27,097
Speaker 1: becomes less important to me and my

1005
01:02:27,117 --> 01:02:27,899
Speaker 1: absolute identity and its story becomes

1006
01:02:27,919 --> 01:02:29,022
Speaker 1: more important to me, that has a huge

1007
01:02:29,042 --> 01:02:33,681
Speaker 1: effect on who I am, how I show up, what I'm

1008
01:02:33,721 --> 01:02:34,846
Speaker 1: doing here and why I'm doing it.

1009
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:38,903
Speaker 1: And it's not a small shift, it's a big one.

1010
01:02:54,848 --> 01:02:56,796
Speaker 1: Enlightenment doesn't exist outside us.

1011
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:01,295
Speaker 1: Enlightened awareness doesn't exist outside

1012
01:03:01,315 --> 01:03:01,355
Speaker 1: us.

1013
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,318
Speaker 1: It exists within all of us.

1014
01:03:06,225 --> 01:03:08,060
Speaker 1: And when consciousness recognizes itself

1015
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:11,610
Speaker 1: and awakens to itself, then the self,

1016
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,124
Speaker 1: that's the container for that consciousness,

1017
01:03:13,144 --> 01:03:15,786
Speaker 1: begins to reflect the light of its own

1018
01:03:16,368 --> 01:03:17,251
Speaker 1: awakened awareness.

1019
01:03:23,422 --> 01:03:24,386
Speaker 1: And that's when we change.

1020
01:03:30,961 --> 01:03:32,526
Speaker 1: That's when the small self no longer has

1021
01:03:32,586 --> 01:03:34,162
Speaker 1: dominion over the body, the mind or the

1022
01:03:34,182 --> 01:03:38,142
Speaker 1: personality Still there, but it's no longer

1023
01:03:38,162 --> 01:04:00,058
Speaker 1: in the driver's seat I received.

1024
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,482
Speaker 1: So oneness is evolving.

1025
01:04:01,502 --> 01:04:04,922
Speaker 1: That's the extraordinary thing Even now,

1026
01:04:04,982 --> 01:04:05,744
Speaker 1: after all these years.

1027
01:04:06,266 --> 01:04:07,870
Speaker 1: It's not a new idea for me, it's not a new

1028
01:04:07,911 --> 01:04:10,505
Speaker 1: truth, but when I think about it, when I

1029
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:15,046
Speaker 1: speak about it, it is as mesmerizing and as

1030
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:19,425
Speaker 1: mind-boggling to me as it was when I first

1031
01:04:19,465 --> 01:04:20,970
Speaker 1: learned about this many years ago.

1032
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:29,599
Speaker 1: When I first learned about this many years

1033
01:04:29,659 --> 01:04:29,860
Speaker 1: ago.

1034
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:30,823
Speaker 1: Because when we use the G word.

1035
01:04:30,843 --> 01:04:31,768
Speaker 1: When we use the God word, we're always

1036
01:04:33,657 --> 01:04:34,340
Speaker 1: thinking of the static principle.

1037
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:41,261
Speaker 1: In some way, shape or form the

1038
01:04:41,542 --> 01:04:43,243
Speaker 1: consciousness of the God principle or the

1039
01:04:43,304 --> 01:04:44,942
Speaker 1: notion of the God principle usually

1040
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:48,051
Speaker 1: represents in the eye of the mind is static

1041
01:04:51,661 --> 01:04:54,308
Speaker 1: that which is static and unchanging, and

1042
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:56,112
Speaker 1: permanent and infinite.

1043
01:04:58,522 --> 01:05:00,086
Speaker 1: But when we realize and discover that that

1044
01:05:00,126 --> 01:05:02,382
Speaker 1: absolute principle is not static, but when

1045
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:08,095
Speaker 1: we realize and discover that that absolute

1046
01:05:08,136 --> 01:05:16,360
Speaker 1: principle is not static, it unhinges our

1047
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,061
Speaker 1: perspective, taking on nature of the

1048
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:19,121
Speaker 1: absolute in the most delightful and

1049
01:05:19,161 --> 01:05:21,222
Speaker 1: extraordinary ways.

1050
01:05:58,718 --> 01:06:00,118
Speaker 1: So a lot of people have questions like well,

1051
01:06:00,138 --> 01:06:01,199
Speaker 1: what is what would be the?

1052
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:02,801
Speaker 1: So a lot of people have questions like well,

1053
01:06:02,821 --> 01:06:07,468
Speaker 1: what would be the most perfect expression

1054
01:06:07,508 --> 01:06:09,591
Speaker 1: of an integration between these absolute

1055
01:06:09,631 --> 01:06:10,833
Speaker 1: and relative levels?

1056
01:06:13,882 --> 01:06:22,068
Speaker 1: I don't know For someone like me.

1057
01:06:22,088 --> 01:06:23,215
Speaker 1: I've always been more interested in the

1058
01:06:23,235 --> 01:06:24,000
Speaker 1: absolute than I have in the relative.

1059
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:25,646
Speaker 1: So I'm not interested in any kind of

1060
01:06:25,666 --> 01:06:26,432
Speaker 1: perfectly balanced integration.

1061
01:06:28,241 --> 01:06:30,020
Speaker 1: The more of the absolute that there is, the

1062
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:30,700
Speaker 1: happier I am.

1063
01:06:30,720 --> 01:07:23,197
Speaker 1: Thank you.

1064
01:07:23,237 --> 01:07:29,761
Speaker 1: A lot of people want to know what does the

1065
01:07:29,821 --> 01:07:30,905
Speaker 1: absolute principle look like?

1066
01:07:31,828 --> 01:07:32,410
Speaker 1: It looks like you.

1067
01:07:33,801 --> 01:07:34,826
Speaker 1: It doesn't look like your ego.

1068
01:07:37,742 --> 01:07:38,847
Speaker 1: It looks just like you do.

1069
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,462
Speaker 1: It doesn't look like your ego.

1070
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:58,371
Speaker 1: And the question is, where is that absolute

1071
01:07:58,411 --> 01:07:59,499
Speaker 1: self, that true self, that authentic self.

1072
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:06,931
Speaker 1: So it was, rightale was right here, right

1073
01:08:06,951 --> 01:08:32,341
Speaker 1: here, where else could it be?

1074
01:08:36,103 --> 01:08:37,424
Speaker 1: Well, very good, I did my best to try and

1075
01:08:37,444 --> 01:09:02,837
Speaker 1: convey a little bit of my understanding of

1076
01:09:02,857 --> 01:09:04,738
Speaker 1: the all dharma discussions.

1077
01:09:04,758 --> 01:09:09,851
Speaker 1: For me is not the revelation of the

1078
01:09:09,911 --> 01:09:13,108
Speaker 1: absolute itself, which, of course, is

1079
01:09:13,148 --> 01:09:16,727
Speaker 1: completely life-changing and totally

1080
01:09:16,767 --> 01:09:22,227
Speaker 1: liberating, but it's the implications for

1081
01:09:22,247 --> 01:09:24,071
Speaker 1: what it means to be a human being that I

1082
01:09:24,111 --> 01:09:25,073
Speaker 1: find the most compelling.

1083
01:09:30,101 --> 01:09:32,246
Speaker 1: If I am God in this absolute principle,

1084
01:09:33,248 --> 01:09:34,952
Speaker 1: awakening to itself and becoming conscious

1085
01:09:34,992 --> 01:09:37,525
Speaker 1: of itself, which is the form of my mind,

1086
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:43,653
Speaker 1: body and personality, and what does that

1087
01:09:43,674 --> 01:09:47,748
Speaker 1: revelation mean about who I am and how I

1088
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:49,713
Speaker 1: should be living out this human experience?

1089
01:09:51,706 --> 01:09:52,970
Speaker 1: That's the most important question.

1090
01:09:53,702 --> 01:09:55,688
Speaker 1: Not the experience itself, which reveals to

1091
01:09:55,748 --> 01:09:59,708
Speaker 1: us what the truth is, but what are the

1092
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:03,907
Speaker 1: implications of this experience for being a

1093
01:10:03,927 --> 01:10:05,351
Speaker 1: human being, for being me?

1094
01:10:07,441 --> 01:10:08,204
Speaker 1: What does it mean?

1095
01:10:08,305 --> 01:10:11,184
Speaker 1: What does it imply About how I'm supposed

1096
01:10:11,204 --> 01:10:15,306
Speaker 1: to show up, act and react and engage with

1097
01:10:15,326 --> 01:10:15,667
Speaker 1: this world?

1098
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,965
Speaker 1: What should my values be?

1099
01:10:17,026 --> 01:10:19,765
Speaker 1: All about my values?

1100
01:10:22,788 --> 01:10:24,516
Speaker 1: If I am God of this absolute principle of

1101
01:10:24,536 --> 01:10:26,103
Speaker 1: awakening to itself through the body, mind,

1102
01:10:26,123 --> 01:10:31,802
Speaker 1: personality of my own self, what dramatic

1103
01:10:31,863 --> 01:10:37,783
Speaker 1: effect would this have on my values as a

1104
01:10:37,844 --> 01:10:38,965
Speaker 1: relative personality.

1105
01:10:49,896 --> 01:11:05,113
Speaker 1: Non-duality Implications are profound, I

1106
01:11:05,133 --> 01:11:06,975
Speaker 1: think, in terms of evolutionary non-duality.

1107
01:11:07,475 --> 01:11:12,160
Speaker 1: We begin to understand that especially when

1108
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:13,785
Speaker 1: we look at the idea of non-duality and

1109
01:11:13,825 --> 01:11:15,672
Speaker 1: evolutionary non-duality in the context of

1110
01:11:17,178 --> 01:11:18,543
Speaker 1: pantheism and panentheism.

1111
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,546
Speaker 1: Pantheism means that the universe is God

1112
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:27,159
Speaker 1: and panentheism means God is the evolving

1113
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:28,845
Speaker 1: universe plus that which transcends the

1114
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:29,768
Speaker 1: evolving universe.

1115
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:36,209
Speaker 1: So if we look at this in the context of an

1116
01:11:36,249 --> 01:11:41,271
Speaker 1: understanding of panentheism and we realize

1117
01:11:41,292 --> 01:11:42,838
Speaker 1: that there's no such thing as an absolute

1118
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:45,706
Speaker 1: principle that stands separate from its own

1119
01:11:46,689 --> 01:11:52,171
Speaker 1: creative process, that begins to mean that

1120
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:56,104
Speaker 1: as we evolve, god and the absolute

1121
01:11:56,124 --> 01:12:01,124
Speaker 1: principle evolve simultaneously and the

1122
01:12:01,164 --> 01:12:03,110
Speaker 1: non-dual implications of that are mind

1123
01:12:03,130 --> 01:12:03,572
Speaker 1: boggling.

1124
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:09,107
Speaker 1: God evolves through me, as me.

1125
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:15,925
Speaker 1: Once again, the implications for

1126
01:12:15,945 --> 01:12:17,364
Speaker 1: understanding of non-duality then become

1127
01:12:17,404 --> 01:12:18,006
Speaker 1: very profound.

1128
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:31,966
Speaker 1: So that puts as sentient beings, as

1129
01:12:32,007 --> 01:12:32,833
Speaker 1: consciously self-aware sentient beings.

1130
01:12:32,853 --> 01:12:33,740
Speaker 1: This pushes up right against the very edge,

1131
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,884
Speaker 1: or what Ken Wilber likes to call the

1132
01:12:35,924 --> 01:12:40,381
Speaker 1: leading edge, of the creative process, and

1133
01:12:40,401 --> 01:12:42,147
Speaker 1: I can't think of a more exciting and more

1134
01:12:42,187 --> 01:12:44,484
Speaker 1: excruciating place to be than the very

1135
01:12:44,544 --> 01:12:46,270
Speaker 1: leading edge of the creative process itself

1136
01:12:47,423 --> 01:12:50,051
Speaker 1: that is beginning to cognize itself,

1137
01:12:50,641 --> 01:12:53,906
Speaker 1: beginning to become conscious of itself in

1138
01:12:53,987 --> 01:12:57,600
Speaker 1: new ways through this biological organism

1139
01:12:57,761 --> 01:12:59,446
Speaker 1: that has these miraculous capacities for

1140
01:12:59,566 --> 01:13:01,071
Speaker 1: self-reflective awareness.

1141
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:11,122
Speaker 1: God evolves through me, as me, through us,

1142
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:11,665
Speaker 1: as us.

1143
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:27,742
Speaker 1: And so when you, when you, if we explore

1144
01:13:27,763 --> 01:13:29,428
Speaker 1: this idea of evolutionary non-duality a

1145
01:13:29,468 --> 01:13:34,007
Speaker 1: little bit more deeply, you begin to

1146
01:13:34,087 --> 01:13:34,769
Speaker 1: realize it's.

1147
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:39,006
Speaker 1: It's hard, heartbreaking, because you

1148
01:13:39,046 --> 01:13:39,648
Speaker 1: realize this.

1149
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:40,891
Speaker 1: There's no guarantees here.

1150
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,086
Speaker 1: The absolute principle is trying to figure

1151
01:13:44,106 --> 01:13:53,025
Speaker 1: this out with us, so there's no guarantees

1152
01:13:53,045 --> 01:13:54,049
Speaker 1: of what the outcome is going to be.

1153
01:13:57,869 --> 01:13:59,522
Speaker 1: Our individual and collective evolution to

1154
01:13:59,562 --> 01:14:01,275
Speaker 1: higher and deeper levels of consciousness

1155
01:14:01,316 --> 01:14:05,786
Speaker 1: and cognition and spiritual realization are

1156
01:14:05,866 --> 01:14:09,971
Speaker 1: imperative for the evolution of the cosmos

1157
01:14:09,991 --> 01:14:13,056
Speaker 1: to unfold in the best possible way.

1158
01:14:15,401 --> 01:14:17,548
Speaker 1: Things can go wrong and do go wrong and are

1159
01:14:17,568 --> 01:14:22,948
Speaker 1: going wrong, and the creative principle is

1160
01:14:22,988 --> 01:14:25,517
Speaker 1: not separate from the forces that are

1161
01:14:25,537 --> 01:14:27,302
Speaker 1: pulling us in what we would consider to be

1162
01:14:27,322 --> 01:14:28,726
Speaker 1: the right direction or the wrong direction.

1163
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,961
Speaker 1: It's all part of the absolute truth that's

1164
01:14:33,462 --> 01:14:35,283
Speaker 1: unbearable to begin to let in.

1165
01:14:50,675 --> 01:14:52,476
Speaker 1: So there are no transcendental guarantees

1166
01:14:52,596 --> 01:14:55,502
Speaker 1: or should-bes beyond what is and beyond

1167
01:14:55,522 --> 01:14:56,426
Speaker 1: what can be right now.

1168
01:15:02,841 --> 01:15:06,689
Speaker 1: So if you let that in, you will feel

1169
01:15:06,729 --> 01:15:08,353
Speaker 1: yourself deeply inspired to wake up.

1170
01:15:09,981 --> 01:15:11,225
Speaker 1: If you really let in what that means?

1171
01:15:11,265 --> 01:15:12,850
Speaker 1: You feel yourself incredibly inspired to

1172
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:19,252
Speaker 1: wake up because you realize that, from the

1173
01:15:19,292 --> 01:15:21,284
Speaker 1: deepest point of view, that the evolution

1174
01:15:21,324 --> 01:15:22,740
Speaker 1: of the interior of the universe, the

1175
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,000
Speaker 1: evolution of the interior of the universe,

1176
01:15:22,879 --> 01:15:24,201
Speaker 1: the evolution of the interior of the cosmos

1177
01:15:24,201 --> 01:15:29,901
Speaker 1: depends upon you and me getting it right.

1178
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:54,507
Speaker 1: So the implications are profound indeed and

1179
01:15:54,547 --> 01:16:43,019
Speaker 1: quite overwhelming, thank you.

1180
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:45,040
Speaker 1: So if God doesn't exist outside the process

1181
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:48,308
Speaker 1: that she gave rise to, then it's up to us,

1182
01:16:49,693 --> 01:16:54,444
Speaker 1: her creation, to do the hard work that she

1183
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:55,388
Speaker 1: can only do through us.

1184
01:16:58,672 --> 01:17:00,298
Speaker 1: That's the profound meaning of evolutionary

1185
01:17:00,338 --> 01:17:00,880
Speaker 1: non-duality.

1186
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,083
Speaker 1: Those are the profound meaning of

1187
01:17:02,103 --> 01:17:02,565
Speaker 1: evolutionary non-duality.

1188
01:17:02,605 --> 01:17:04,049
Speaker 1: Those are the profound implications, and

1189
01:17:04,089 --> 01:17:04,691
Speaker 1: they are big.
