1
00:00:01,061 --> 00:00:02,607
Speaker 1: Thank you, hello everybody, nice to see you,

2
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:05,946
Speaker 1: it's always good to be together.

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:15,250
Speaker 1: So I wanted to talk today about what makes

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,782
Speaker 1: enlightenment actually possible, because

5
00:00:17,822 --> 00:00:26,388
Speaker 1: it's a very mysterious process and I want

6
00:00:26,408 --> 00:00:29,173
Speaker 1: to try to help to demystify how it all

7
00:00:29,214 --> 00:00:29,514
Speaker 1: works.

8
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:33,867
Speaker 1: I can't ultimately demystify it, because

9
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:36,453
Speaker 1: how it works is ultimately a mystery to me,

10
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:39,547
Speaker 1: but I have come to understand a few things

11
00:00:39,587 --> 00:00:44,188
Speaker 1: about it and I hope, today to help to

12
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:49,686
Speaker 1: demystify what we can actually do if we

13
00:00:49,746 --> 00:00:53,501
Speaker 1: want to maintain enlightened awareness and

14
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,627
Speaker 1: cultivate the capacity to experience it on

15
00:00:55,668 --> 00:00:56,430
Speaker 1: a regular basis.

16
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:04,474
Speaker 1: I think I can help in this area.

17
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,140
Speaker 1: I think I can help in this area.

18
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:20,154
Speaker 1: So, in my understanding, there's basically

19
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:21,360
Speaker 1: two approaches to enlightenment.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,765
Speaker 1: One is called the gradual path.

21
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:30,989
Speaker 1: The gradual path takes time and continuous

22
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:33,322
Speaker 1: practice and effort, and then there's the

23
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:34,749
Speaker 1: sudden path, which happens instantaneously

24
00:01:37,302 --> 00:01:40,931
Speaker 1: and it's not something you need to work at.

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,108
Speaker 1: So there's what's called the path of sudden

26
00:01:46,128 --> 00:01:50,047
Speaker 1: awakening versus the gradual path, which

27
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:50,689
Speaker 1: takes time.

28
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:59,741
Speaker 1: I became a seeker when I was 22, and I

29
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:04,701
Speaker 1: practiced Kriya Yoga, which is a form of

30
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,565
Speaker 1: Kundalini Yoga meditation, for several

31
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:10,612
Speaker 1: years very seriously, which is a gradual

32
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:14,326
Speaker 1: path of awakening, and I had many powerful

33
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:15,410
Speaker 1: experiences doing that.

34
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,028
Speaker 1: And then, like so many other people.

35
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:20,120
Speaker 1: I began to practice Vipassana meditation.

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,529
Speaker 1: I did many, many intensive, long

37
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:26,293
Speaker 1: Viposterous retreats, some for months on

38
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:32,908
Speaker 1: end, and that form of Buddhist meditation

39
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:36,354
Speaker 1: is definitely a gradual path, very gradual,

40
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:42,046
Speaker 1: and I learned a lot about the nature of my

41
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:43,951
Speaker 1: mind, the nature of mind.

42
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:48,845
Speaker 1: I learned a lot about taking the position

43
00:02:48,865 --> 00:02:51,411
Speaker 1: of being the witness to all of our

44
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:55,684
Speaker 1: experience and I experienced many deep

45
00:02:55,764 --> 00:02:59,032
Speaker 1: states of consciousness during those

46
00:02:59,072 --> 00:02:59,453
Speaker 1: retreats.

47
00:03:03,301 --> 00:03:04,586
Speaker 1: But I didn't find what I was looking for

48
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:06,942
Speaker 1: until I met my guru, the great HWL Punja,

49
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:18,052
Speaker 1: in 1986 in Lucknow and after sitting in

50
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:23,144
Speaker 1: front of him for about 10 minutes, I had a

51
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:26,990
Speaker 1: very powerful experience of awakening to

52
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,852
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness.

53
00:03:30,422 --> 00:03:32,046
Speaker 1: That happened very quickly.

54
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:36,136
Speaker 1: After sitting in front of in front of me

55
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:40,845
Speaker 1: for, as I said, a very short time, I had a

56
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:43,689
Speaker 1: mysterious and miraculous realization that

57
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:46,353
Speaker 1: I'd always at the deepest level level of

58
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:50,621
Speaker 1: consciousness, I'd always been free and

59
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:53,447
Speaker 1: that, as I understood it at the time,

60
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:56,413
Speaker 1: unenlightenment was only a thought.

61
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:04,150
Speaker 1: So my guru, hw Alpunja, was a teacher of

62
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,793
Speaker 1: instant enlightenment.

63
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:09,550
Speaker 1: He was not an advocate of the gradual path.

64
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,848
Speaker 1: He disdained any approach to the absolute

65
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:14,791
Speaker 1: or to enlightenment.

66
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:23,171
Speaker 1: That took time Because he said he was a

67
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:24,674
Speaker 1: disciple of Ramana Maharshi.

68
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,147
Speaker 1: Ramana Maharshi called ultimate or absolute

69
00:04:28,187 --> 00:04:31,125
Speaker 1: reality, the self, capital, s-c-l-l.

70
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:38,732
Speaker 1: So he said, if the self exists beyond time,

71
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:43,724
Speaker 1: how could doing anything in time help you

72
00:04:43,764 --> 00:04:44,928
Speaker 1: to get beyond time?

73
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:53,471
Speaker 1: So, in his approach, if you wanted to be

74
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:54,894
Speaker 1: free, if you wanted to attain enlightened

75
00:04:54,934 --> 00:04:59,987
Speaker 1: awareness, you needed to recognize that at

76
00:05:00,028 --> 00:05:01,731
Speaker 1: the deepest level of your being it was

77
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:02,212
Speaker 1: already so.

78
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,074
Speaker 1: The deepest level of your being, it was

79
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:03,696
Speaker 1: already so.

80
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:08,440
Speaker 1: It was always already so.

81
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,403
Speaker 1: Because, from the perspective of the path

82
00:05:12,423 --> 00:05:13,346
Speaker 1: of Advaita Vedanta and the realization of

83
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:17,621
Speaker 1: non-duality that he was teaching, advaita

84
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:19,186
Speaker 1: Vedanta always points us directly to the

85
00:05:19,226 --> 00:05:20,450
Speaker 1: nature of our own consciousness.

86
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:23,866
Speaker 1: Just look and pay attention to the nature

87
00:05:23,886 --> 00:05:24,890
Speaker 1: of your own consciousness.

88
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,222
Speaker 1: Just look and pay attention to the nature

89
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:28,804
Speaker 1: of your own consciousness.

90
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:29,666
Speaker 1: See that consciousness, that your own

91
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:30,649
Speaker 1: subjective experience of interiority of

92
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:35,863
Speaker 1: consciousness is timeless and formless and

93
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,005
Speaker 1: beginningless and endless.

94
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:45,933
Speaker 1: Right now, consciousness, the awakening to

95
00:05:45,973 --> 00:05:47,216
Speaker 1: consciousness, the recognition of

96
00:05:47,276 --> 00:05:48,620
Speaker 1: consciousness, the discovery of

97
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,327
Speaker 1: consciousness, is what awakening to

98
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:52,871
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness in the traditional

99
00:05:52,891 --> 00:05:53,693
Speaker 1: sense is all about.

100
00:05:58,221 --> 00:05:59,904
Speaker 1: When you discover your own consciousness,

101
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:04,073
Speaker 1: when you stumble upon your own

102
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:05,785
Speaker 1: consciousness, which most people miss.

103
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:10,023
Speaker 1: That's what enlightenment is and that's

104
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:13,503
Speaker 1: either a temporary realization or it can

105
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:14,888
Speaker 1: become a sustained realization.

106
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:19,823
Speaker 1: So consciousness, which is the source of

107
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:24,221
Speaker 1: the subjective sense of I-ness, it's the

108
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:25,447
Speaker 1: source of the I-sense.

109
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,827
Speaker 1: Your consciousness and my consciousness is

110
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:33,024
Speaker 1: the source of who I am and the source of

111
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:33,627
Speaker 1: who you are.

112
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,945
Speaker 1: Most of us don't know that.

113
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,283
Speaker 1: Most of us believe that who we are is a

114
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:40,169
Speaker 1: separate self-sense that had a beginning in

115
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:40,530
Speaker 1: time.

116
00:06:43,681 --> 00:06:45,570
Speaker 1: But when we awaken to consciousness itself,

117
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,800
Speaker 1: when we awaken to consciousness directly,

118
00:06:50,024 --> 00:06:54,692
Speaker 1: we realize that the source of the mystery

119
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:59,180
Speaker 1: of interiority or subjectivity is infinite

120
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:02,888
Speaker 1: and abides beyond time.

121
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:04,612
Speaker 1: Because it abides beyond time, it abides

122
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,233
Speaker 1: beyond the mind.

123
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,722
Speaker 1: So when this discovery is made, this is the

124
00:07:11,742 --> 00:07:12,926
Speaker 1: beginning of the awakening to enlightenment,

125
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:13,789
Speaker 1: to enlightened awareness.

126
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:27,812
Speaker 1: We can work at this in the meditative

127
00:07:27,852 --> 00:07:29,500
Speaker 1: process or in the practice of meditation.

128
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,951
Speaker 1: We can work to try and transcend the mind

129
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:37,151
Speaker 1: using meditative techniques.

130
00:07:39,146 --> 00:07:44,451
Speaker 1: And this can and does and will, if we stick

131
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:47,118
Speaker 1: with it long enough and if we are serious

132
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:51,082
Speaker 1: enough about it, will give us glimpses into

133
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:52,383
Speaker 1: what lays beyond our own mind.

134
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,952
Speaker 1: In the situation with my own teacher,

135
00:08:07,335 --> 00:08:12,360
Speaker 1: because his awakening was so powerful, his

136
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:18,147
Speaker 1: enlightenment was so powerful that it was

137
00:08:18,187 --> 00:08:20,935
Speaker 1: his physical presence, it was being in his

138
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:23,768
Speaker 1: physical presence, it was the being in his

139
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:25,193
Speaker 1: physical presence that made the immediacy

140
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:29,428
Speaker 1: of the awakening to the timeless and

141
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,310
Speaker 1: formless and beginningless and endless

142
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,987
Speaker 1: nature of consciousness so tangible and so

143
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:37,327
Speaker 1: possible and many people not just myself

144
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,946
Speaker 1: but many people as a result of sitting in

145
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:46,981
Speaker 1: his presence and trusting him, that

146
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:48,667
Speaker 1: powerful realization of enlightened

147
00:08:48,687 --> 00:08:49,129
Speaker 1: awareness.

148
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:55,168
Speaker 1: So there's two fundamental approaches to

149
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:55,650
Speaker 1: enlightenment.

150
00:08:55,941 --> 00:08:58,842
Speaker 1: One is the gradual path, which tells us

151
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:02,872
Speaker 1: that if you practice a particular technique

152
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:05,766
Speaker 1: in the context of a particular philosophy

153
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:08,331
Speaker 1: consistently over a long period of time,

154
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,662
Speaker 1: you'll eventually get there, you'll

155
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:13,528
Speaker 1: eventually become enlightened and realize

156
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:14,351
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness.

157
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:22,846
Speaker 1: The path of sudden awakening says

158
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:25,560
Speaker 1: enlightenment is your own true nature, it's

159
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,126
Speaker 1: your natural state and it's always already

160
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:27,507
Speaker 1: the case.

161
00:09:27,587 --> 00:09:28,289
Speaker 1: Realize it now.

162
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,866
Speaker 1: Realize that there's nothing in the way and

163
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:34,310
Speaker 1: there never has been anything in the way.

164
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:41,929
Speaker 1: And if you can do that, if you can realize

165
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,383
Speaker 1: there's nothing in the way, then suddenly

166
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:44,206
Speaker 1: nothing is in the way.

167
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,187
Speaker 1: And when you have that kind of experience

168
00:09:49,384 --> 00:09:51,290
Speaker 1: you realize that it didn't need to take so

169
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:51,871
Speaker 1: much time.

170
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:57,896
Speaker 1: I had been practicing meditation very

171
00:09:57,937 --> 00:10:01,931
Speaker 1: diligently for about eight or nine years

172
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:05,002
Speaker 1: before I met my guru and I spent 10 minutes

173
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:08,872
Speaker 1: in his presence and it happened.

174
00:10:18,621 --> 00:10:25,801
Speaker 1: Now, usually how it goes is that the those

175
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:29,201
Speaker 1: who are advocates of sudden awakening, the

176
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:34,465
Speaker 1: path of sudden awakening mock, tend to mock

177
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:37,526
Speaker 1: those paths that preach gradual awakening

178
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,437
Speaker 1: and the similar way the path of gradual

179
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:48,288
Speaker 1: awakening than to mock the path of sudden

180
00:10:48,308 --> 00:10:48,730
Speaker 1: awakening.

181
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:57,649
Speaker 1: Now, in my own case, after teaching for 35

182
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:00,800
Speaker 1: years and meeting a lot of people and

183
00:11:00,821 --> 00:11:02,306
Speaker 1: seeing a lot of people go through this kind

184
00:11:02,326 --> 00:11:07,460
Speaker 1: of process, I've come to the conclusion

185
00:11:09,987 --> 00:11:13,738
Speaker 1: that I believe both of these approaches are

186
00:11:13,818 --> 00:11:16,645
Speaker 1: necessary in order to embrace a complete

187
00:11:17,347 --> 00:11:20,073
Speaker 1: path of awakening.

188
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,030
Speaker 1: So, as I'm fond of saying, awakening is

189
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,280
Speaker 1: easy, staying awake is very difficult.

190
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:41,026
Speaker 1: It's much easier to awaken initially than

191
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:44,406
Speaker 1: it is to stay awake, and I can't tell you

192
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:46,632
Speaker 1: how many times I've met people who've told

193
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:51,549
Speaker 1: me I had the most amazing experience of

194
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:53,373
Speaker 1: awakening at a particular point in my life

195
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,465
Speaker 1: and then I lost touch with it.

196
00:11:56,221 --> 00:11:57,807
Speaker 1: When we have a profound awakening, we lose

197
00:11:57,847 --> 00:11:58,289
Speaker 1: touch with it.

198
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,723
Speaker 1: We find ourselves very lost at sea, not

199
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:05,443
Speaker 1: really sure where to go or what to do or

200
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:06,908
Speaker 1: how to get back to where we thought we were.

201
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:26,745
Speaker 1: So it's my belief, it's my opinion that

202
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:34,319
Speaker 1: unless we have a profound experience of

203
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,881
Speaker 1: awakening to enlightened awareness, unless

204
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,284
Speaker 1: we really have an experience of waking up

205
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:50,796
Speaker 1: that is radical, radical and explosive that

206
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:54,624
Speaker 1: it will be, unless we do that, it will be

207
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:56,750
Speaker 1: very difficult to practice the path, the

208
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,224
Speaker 1: gradual path, because many people who are

209
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:02,755
Speaker 1: long-term meditators, who haven't become

210
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:03,560
Speaker 1: enlightened yet or haven't gained access to

211
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:04,403
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness becometerm meditators.

212
00:13:04,337 --> 00:13:04,752
Speaker 1: Who haven't become enlightened yet or

213
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:05,911
Speaker 1: haven't gained access to enlightened

214
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:06,990
Speaker 1: awareness become good meditators.

215
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:11,394
Speaker 1: But they've given up on the goal which is

216
00:13:11,434 --> 00:13:11,840
Speaker 1: enlightenment.

217
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:15,029
Speaker 1: And I'm sure all of you remember the very

218
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,781
Speaker 1: famous Zen phrase saying that says don't

219
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,087
Speaker 1: mistake the finger for the moon.

220
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:23,820
Speaker 1: The moon represents enlightenment.

221
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,331
Speaker 1: Meditation is the finger pointing to moon.

222
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:30,055
Speaker 1: The moon represents enlightenment,

223
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:31,238
Speaker 1: meditation is the finger pointing to it.

224
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,000
Speaker 1: Don't mistake the finger for the moon,

225
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,506
Speaker 1: don't mistake the practice of meditation

226
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,480
Speaker 1: for enlightenment itself.

227
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,217
Speaker 1: So I believe that unless we are in some way

228
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:48,918
Speaker 1: grounded as a result of having deep

229
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:50,843
Speaker 1: experiences, unless we're grounded in a

230
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:56,874
Speaker 1: deep recognition of enlightened awareness,

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,789
Speaker 1: unless we are deeply grounded in a faith

232
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:02,313
Speaker 1: about the fact that enlightenment is real,

233
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,147
Speaker 1: based upon what we've experienced ourself,

234
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,926
Speaker 1: it's going to be very difficult, I think,

235
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:11,307
Speaker 1: to sustain a passionate and enthusiastic

236
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:15,033
Speaker 1: meditation practice and process over a long

237
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:15,694
Speaker 1: period of time.

238
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,865
Speaker 1: Because our practice, unless the meditation

239
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:23,709
Speaker 1: practice is deeply connected to our

240
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,535
Speaker 1: awakening experientially in the present

241
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:33,126
Speaker 1: moment, what tends to happen is the

242
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,987
Speaker 1: meditation process tends to get dry and

243
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:36,830
Speaker 1: uninspired.

244
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:47,226
Speaker 1: When I began teaching in 1986, shortly

245
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:49,011
Speaker 1: after I met my guru, many people were

246
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:51,644
Speaker 1: having very dramatic awakening experiences

247
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:53,608
Speaker 1: very quickly and very suddenly all over the

248
00:14:53,648 --> 00:14:57,046
Speaker 1: place and it was quite something to behold.

249
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,527
Speaker 1: It was miraculous, glorious, extraordinary

250
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,090
Speaker 1: and so deeply inspiring.

251
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,886
Speaker 1: We called in those days, people were

252
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:15,075
Speaker 1: popping and I, wrongly, was beginning to

253
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:20,067
Speaker 1: think that if this miracle kept happening,

254
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:22,989
Speaker 1: that the world would never be the same.

255
00:15:26,423 --> 00:15:28,490
Speaker 1: So what I noticed was happening was that

256
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:36,096
Speaker 1: people were having these dramatic

257
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:38,220
Speaker 1: enlightenment, awakening experiences.

258
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:41,590
Speaker 1: But I started to notice over time that they

259
00:15:45,732 --> 00:15:48,721
Speaker 1: so I've to notice over time that they that

260
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:49,683
Speaker 1: unsupported by my presence, that their

261
00:15:49,703 --> 00:15:51,649
Speaker 1: awakening unsupported by my physical

262
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:57,468
Speaker 1: presence, that if their access to

263
00:15:57,508 --> 00:15:59,083
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness was not supported by

264
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:03,126
Speaker 1: my physical presence, most people over a

265
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:08,562
Speaker 1: period of time, eventually would fall out

266
00:16:08,582 --> 00:16:11,254
Speaker 1: of that state and lose access to what they

267
00:16:11,414 --> 00:16:11,716
Speaker 1: knew.

268
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:15,087
Speaker 1: Because I thought in those days that what

269
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,827
Speaker 1: had happened to me when I met my guru had

270
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:18,469
Speaker 1: happened to them.

271
00:16:19,022 --> 00:16:21,232
Speaker 1: It seemed like they were experiencing the

272
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,322
Speaker 1: same dramatic shift in consciousness that I

273
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:25,503
Speaker 1: did when I met my guru, but I started to

274
00:16:25,523 --> 00:16:26,629
Speaker 1: find out over a period of months they were

275
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:27,594
Speaker 1: experiencing the same dramatic shift in

276
00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:28,800
Speaker 1: consciousness that I did when I met my guru,

277
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:34,019
Speaker 1: but I started to find out over a period of

278
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:38,294
Speaker 1: months that it didn't seem to be quite the

279
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:39,540
Speaker 1: same, that they had a similar experience,

280
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:44,124
Speaker 1: but the long-term result of a stabilized

281
00:16:44,144 --> 00:16:49,331
Speaker 1: awakening was not the case, was not the

282
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:49,431
Speaker 1: case.

283
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:49,931
Speaker 1: It was not the outcome.

284
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:56,220
Speaker 1: So when I started teaching, I was a strict

285
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,422
Speaker 1: teacher of the sudden path.

286
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:02,232
Speaker 1: I actually told people when they were

287
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:03,822
Speaker 1: coming to me, if they were meditators, to

288
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:14,427
Speaker 1: stop meditating, because I said, if you

289
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:17,835
Speaker 1: think that meditating is going to get you

290
00:17:17,855 --> 00:17:18,516
Speaker 1: there, then you're waiting.

291
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:19,799
Speaker 1: I was very radical myself in those days.

292
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,026
Speaker 1: I said if you think meditation is going to

293
00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:23,091
Speaker 1: help you to get somewhere that you aren't

294
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:24,939
Speaker 1: already, you need to wait for something to

295
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,486
Speaker 1: happen, and if you're waiting, you're never

296
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:26,930
Speaker 1: going gonna get there.

297
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,435
Speaker 1: You have to stop waiting.

298
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:28,020
Speaker 1: When should I stop waiting?

299
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,224
Speaker 1: You need to stop waiting right now.

300
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,145
Speaker 1: That's when things got interesting and kind

301
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:35,227
Speaker 1: of exciting and people would begin to

302
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,844
Speaker 1: consider what would it be like to stop

303
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:38,249
Speaker 1: waiting to awaken?

304
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,191
Speaker 1: But in any case, I can't remember how long

305
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,248
Speaker 1: it took me Maybe it was a year or so, I

306
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:52,123
Speaker 1: can't remember how long but at a certain

307
00:17:52,163 --> 00:17:57,059
Speaker 1: point it dawned on me that this process of

308
00:17:57,099 --> 00:18:01,136
Speaker 1: awakening to enlightened awareness and the

309
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:02,601
Speaker 1: completeness and fullness of this kind of

310
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:06,310
Speaker 1: transformation was not necessarily going to

311
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,666
Speaker 1: be so easy for most people as it had

312
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:13,464
Speaker 1: apparently been for me, and I realized that

313
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:15,089
Speaker 1: we all have to work our way through this.

314
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,895
Speaker 1: We all have to learn how to learn to

315
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:20,803
Speaker 1: understand the human condition by

316
00:18:20,843 --> 00:18:25,746
Speaker 1: struggling to understand it, by struggling

317
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:34,712
Speaker 1: to understand it, and we all needed to make

318
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:35,922
Speaker 1: the effort to struggle to get to know

319
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:40,708
Speaker 1: ourselves on a personal level and on a

320
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:41,451
Speaker 1: spiritual level.

321
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:45,700
Speaker 1: We needed to do the very hard work, the

322
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,144
Speaker 1: hard spiritual work, of understanding

323
00:18:47,205 --> 00:18:49,591
Speaker 1: ourselves emotionally and psychologically,

324
00:18:51,702 --> 00:18:53,131
Speaker 1: and also we needed to have the experience

325
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:54,500
Speaker 1: of these higher states of consciousness

326
00:18:56,044 --> 00:18:57,629
Speaker 1: that would reveal the absolute nature of

327
00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:00,948
Speaker 1: reality to us and change our relationship

328
00:19:00,968 --> 00:19:01,610
Speaker 1: for life forever.

329
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,263
Speaker 1: But I realized that this was not a matter

330
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:02,665
Speaker 1: of snapping one's fingers.

331
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,990
Speaker 1: That will change our relationship for life

332
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:03,122
Speaker 1: forever.

333
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:03,920
Speaker 1: But I realized that this is not a matter of

334
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,865
Speaker 1: snapping one's fingers.

335
00:19:06,802 --> 00:19:07,204
Speaker 1: It was not.

336
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:09,044
Speaker 1: For most people, it wasn't a matter of an

337
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:10,308
Speaker 1: instantaneous recognition.

338
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,987
Speaker 1: It would lead to a stabilized result.

339
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:16,205
Speaker 1: This is something we all needed to be

340
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:19,166
Speaker 1: working on continuously and perpetually.

341
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,887
Speaker 1: So after a while, I started telling my

342
00:19:34,947 --> 00:19:37,618
Speaker 1: students, teaching them and telling them to

343
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:38,581
Speaker 1: begin to meditate a lot, and so I taught

344
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:41,929
Speaker 1: them how to meditate and how to practice

345
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:43,881
Speaker 1: the art not only of meditation, but also

346
00:19:43,922 --> 00:19:47,422
Speaker 1: contemplation and introspection Meditation,

347
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:56,790
Speaker 1: contemplation, introspection, and so I

348
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,945
Speaker 1: wanted everybody to learn how to awaken, to

349
00:19:58,985 --> 00:19:59,788
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness.

350
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,101
Speaker 1: But I also wanted everybody to learn how to

351
00:20:02,121 --> 00:20:05,602
Speaker 1: be an awakened human being, which meant

352
00:20:05,642 --> 00:20:09,006
Speaker 1: learning how to be vulnerable, learning how

353
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:11,870
Speaker 1: to be transparent, learning how to be

354
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,736
Speaker 1: authentic, learning how to have soul level

355
00:20:16,796 --> 00:20:17,296
Speaker 1: integrity.

356
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,486
Speaker 1: Most people don't know how to do those

357
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:24,847
Speaker 1: things and I realized that this all needs

358
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:25,950
Speaker 1: to be worked on.

359
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,826
Speaker 1: Most of us need to work on our own

360
00:20:31,527 --> 00:20:34,233
Speaker 1: transformation perpetually.

361
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,129
Speaker 1: Most of the greatest musicians practice all

362
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:51,530
Speaker 1: the time.

363
00:20:57,032 --> 00:21:00,047
Speaker 1: Now, for me, ever since I've been 22, this

364
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:04,583
Speaker 1: matter of what is enlightenment and my

365
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:08,109
Speaker 1: interest in it has been the driving passion

366
00:21:11,434 --> 00:21:14,790
Speaker 1: in my life and it remains to be the case.

367
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:17,727
Speaker 1: So I'm kind of obsessed with this question

368
00:21:17,747 --> 00:21:25,730
Speaker 1: about what is enlightenment For most people.

369
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:27,483
Speaker 1: Their interest in enlightenment usually

370
00:21:27,523 --> 00:21:31,886
Speaker 1: tends to be a passing fancy, something we

371
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:33,350
Speaker 1: become interested in for a certain period

372
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,988
Speaker 1: of time and a certain period in our life.

373
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:38,406
Speaker 1: We might become fascinated by the

374
00:21:38,446 --> 00:21:45,384
Speaker 1: possibility, but often life circumstances

375
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:48,827
Speaker 1: change or we may get distracted by some

376
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:56,413
Speaker 1: kind of event or desire, get distracted

377
00:21:57,314 --> 00:21:59,936
Speaker 1: away from this primary motivation and

378
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:05,730
Speaker 1: primary goal, and we forget about it for a

379
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,113
Speaker 1: period of time or maybe forever.

380
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:13,744
Speaker 1: So I've come to the conclusion that, if

381
00:22:14,926 --> 00:22:17,692
Speaker 1: we're going to go deep and we're going to

382
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:21,990
Speaker 1: stay deep, then I'm not ashamed to say that

383
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,219
Speaker 1: I believe embracing this kind of spiritual

384
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:30,121
Speaker 1: process needs to become an obsession, and

385
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:31,204
Speaker 1: why shouldn't that be the case?

386
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,611
Speaker 1: Why shouldn't it be true?

387
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,448
Speaker 1: Now, what I wanted to speak about today was

388
00:22:48,328 --> 00:22:52,048
Speaker 1: the good news, which is the fact that we

389
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,611
Speaker 1: there's a lot of help available for us.

390
00:22:59,101 --> 00:23:01,281
Speaker 1: There have been many great human beings who

391
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:04,022
Speaker 1: have walked this path before us and have

392
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:07,102
Speaker 1: gone very far and very deep, and so there's

393
00:23:07,142 --> 00:23:12,200
Speaker 1: so much information available to us that

394
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:12,941
Speaker 1: it's extraordinary.

395
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:13,621
Speaker 1: We're very lucky.

396
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:30,455
Speaker 1: So if we can liberate ourselves from a

397
00:23:32,456 --> 00:23:42,453
Speaker 1: conscious and unconscious, irrational,

398
00:23:42,473 --> 00:23:43,478
Speaker 1: egoic reluctance to give ourselves to the

399
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:52,335
Speaker 1: process of awakening, there's so much

400
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:53,739
Speaker 1: information available to us that can help

401
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,039
Speaker 1: us wake up.

402
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:58,716
Speaker 1: Once you wake up, it becomes very obvious

403
00:23:58,797 --> 00:23:59,399
Speaker 1: how to do this.

404
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,888
Speaker 1: Before one wakes up, it's not so obvious.

405
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:03,970
Speaker 1: I don't know if many of you have heard of

406
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:12,305
Speaker 1: the great spirit, the great 20th century

407
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,890
Speaker 1: spiritual master, j Krishnamurti, but he

408
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,394
Speaker 1: was such a powerful realizer, but when

409
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,662
Speaker 1: people were listening to him, most people

410
00:24:18,682 --> 00:24:19,826
Speaker 1: could never understand what he was talking

411
00:24:19,866 --> 00:24:24,345
Speaker 1: about, and I remember when I would read

412
00:24:24,425 --> 00:24:27,892
Speaker 1: books by about the teachings of Ramana

413
00:24:27,912 --> 00:24:30,664
Speaker 1: Maharshi and other great non-dual realizers,

414
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:33,671
Speaker 1: I never quite could figure out what they

415
00:24:33,691 --> 00:24:34,112
Speaker 1: were saying.

416
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:37,068
Speaker 1: I mean I, it was beautiful and it attracted

417
00:24:37,088 --> 00:24:38,211
Speaker 1: me, but I didn't understand it.

418
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:42,356
Speaker 1: But after I spent some time with my guru

419
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:44,725
Speaker 1: and had a life-changing awakening, suddenly

420
00:24:44,664 --> 00:24:44,878
Speaker 1: it was all I could understand it.

421
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:45,172
Speaker 1: I could understand what they were saying.

422
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:45,365
Speaker 1: But after I spent some time with my guru

423
00:24:45,304 --> 00:24:46,342
Speaker 1: and had a life-changing awakening, suddenly

424
00:24:46,382 --> 00:24:47,968
Speaker 1: it was all I could understand it.

425
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,466
Speaker 1: I could understand what they were saying

426
00:24:49,882 --> 00:24:51,026
Speaker 1: because I knew where they were speaking

427
00:24:51,046 --> 00:24:54,406
Speaker 1: from and it was all very clear.

428
00:24:59,621 --> 00:25:00,945
Speaker 1: In order to understand what awakening is

429
00:25:00,965 --> 00:25:02,069
Speaker 1: all about, we've got to do it.

430
00:25:03,721 --> 00:25:05,285
Speaker 1: The more we do it, the more we understand.

431
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:06,669
Speaker 1: The more we do it, the more we have access

432
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:10,007
Speaker 1: to the source of awakening, consciousness

433
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:10,388
Speaker 1: itself.

434
00:25:10,428 --> 00:25:13,427
Speaker 1: And then it becomes very easy for us and

435
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:14,150
Speaker 1: very palpable.

436
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,016
Speaker 1: Now I teach enlightenment in an interesting,

437
00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:42,703
Speaker 1: slightly complex context, because I divide

438
00:25:42,823 --> 00:25:43,765
Speaker 1: enlightenment into two expressions.

439
00:25:43,785 --> 00:25:45,348
Speaker 1: I make a distinction between what I call

440
00:25:45,428 --> 00:25:53,091
Speaker 1: being enlightened, being enlightened, being

441
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:54,599
Speaker 1: enlightened is the enlightenment of the

442
00:25:54,639 --> 00:25:56,410
Speaker 1: Buddha, is the enlightenment of the great

443
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,487
Speaker 1: Eckhart Tolle, is the awakening to what

444
00:25:59,507 --> 00:26:01,032
Speaker 1: Eckhart Tolle calls the ground of being

445
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,244
Speaker 1: what the Buddha called the uncreated and

446
00:26:04,264 --> 00:26:05,130
Speaker 1: the unborn.

447
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,419
Speaker 1: It's also grounded being what the Buddha

448
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:12,982
Speaker 1: called the uncreated and the unborn being.

449
00:26:13,002 --> 00:26:13,984
Speaker 1: Enlightenment is awakening to that

450
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:16,029
Speaker 1: mysterious depth dimension that exists

451
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:25,174
Speaker 1: prior to time, prior to space, prior to the

452
00:26:25,195 --> 00:26:26,420
Speaker 1: emergence of the universe.

453
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,604
Speaker 1: It's awakening to that primordial emptiness,

454
00:26:28,624 --> 00:26:31,394
Speaker 1: or that primordial vacuum of no-thingness

455
00:26:31,454 --> 00:26:35,087
Speaker 1: or nothingness, infinite nothingness, where

456
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:37,505
Speaker 1: there's no time and there's no space and

457
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:38,347
Speaker 1: there's no mind.

458
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,432
Speaker 1: There's just emptiness.

459
00:26:42,462 --> 00:26:45,013
Speaker 1: Because that emptiness exists before time

460
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:46,520
Speaker 1: and before space and before the universe

461
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,302
Speaker 1: ever existed.

462
00:26:48,004 --> 00:26:51,314
Speaker 1: It's a place and a space of unconditional,

463
00:26:51,756 --> 00:26:53,901
Speaker 1: unimaginable, inconceivable freedom,

464
00:26:55,604 --> 00:26:56,686
Speaker 1: inconceivable freedom.

465
00:26:58,209 --> 00:26:59,712
Speaker 1: It's a space of inconceivable freedom

466
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:02,082
Speaker 1: because before the universe was created,

467
00:27:02,883 --> 00:27:03,705
Speaker 1: nothing had ever happened.

468
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:06,450
Speaker 1: Before nothing had ever happened.

469
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,833
Speaker 1: Before anything had ever happened, nothing

470
00:27:07,853 --> 00:27:10,969
Speaker 1: was wrong, nothing could be wrong.

471
00:27:14,914 --> 00:27:16,500
Speaker 1: So it's awakening to this depth dimension

472
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,966
Speaker 1: that the Buddha called the uncreated and

473
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:21,149
Speaker 1: the unborn, the Ramana called the self,

474
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,860
Speaker 1: that Akartoli calls the ground of being.

475
00:27:23,763 --> 00:27:27,068
Speaker 1: That's the source of the traditional

476
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:27,750
Speaker 1: enlightenment.

477
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:35,088
Speaker 1: When we awaken to the ground of being, to

478
00:27:35,108 --> 00:27:40,042
Speaker 1: the self, to that which is uncreated, we

479
00:27:40,103 --> 00:27:42,129
Speaker 1: experience that peace that passes all

480
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:42,791
Speaker 1: understanding.

481
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,988
Speaker 1: And the reason we do is because before the

482
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:52,873
Speaker 1: universe was created there was only peace.

483
00:27:52,893 --> 00:27:53,577
Speaker 1: Nothing had happened.

484
00:27:53,598 --> 00:27:53,678
Speaker 1: Yet.

485
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,163
Speaker 1: I think we should just try and imagine how

486
00:27:55,184 --> 00:27:56,247
Speaker 1: peaceful would it be if nothing had ever

487
00:27:56,287 --> 00:28:00,804
Speaker 1: happened yet, if the evolving universe had

488
00:28:00,824 --> 00:28:04,025
Speaker 1: not even emerged in the mind of God, yet as

489
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:04,547
Speaker 1: an idea.

490
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,045
Speaker 1: How peaceful would it be?

491
00:28:07,581 --> 00:28:11,011
Speaker 1: It's unimaginably, inconceivably peaceful.

492
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,726
Speaker 1: So it's the experience of that kind of

493
00:28:15,826 --> 00:28:20,490
Speaker 1: unimaginable, inconceivable peace that we

494
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,304
Speaker 1: seek our release from suffering and from

495
00:28:23,404 --> 00:28:24,647
Speaker 1: ignorance and from bondage.

496
00:28:25,408 --> 00:28:27,172
Speaker 1: In this traditional approach to the being

497
00:28:27,232 --> 00:28:32,245
Speaker 1: enlightenment and the way the being

498
00:28:32,305 --> 00:28:34,866
Speaker 1: enlightenment to break it down and make it

499
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:35,922
Speaker 1: very simple, the way the being

500
00:28:35,942 --> 00:28:38,926
Speaker 1: enlightenment works is the being

501
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:40,470
Speaker 1: enlightenment is usually approached through

502
00:28:41,724 --> 00:28:51,760
Speaker 1: transcending the mind, learning how to let

503
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:52,161
Speaker 1: go of the mind.

504
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:56,765
Speaker 1: So the way the being Enlightenment works is

505
00:28:57,146 --> 00:28:58,291
Speaker 1: Very simply, through letting go.

506
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:04,437
Speaker 1: Can you or I let go of our mind?

507
00:29:04,485 --> 00:29:08,695
Speaker 1: The mind is not just thought, but it's the

508
00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:10,218
Speaker 1: realm of your personal identity.

509
00:29:12,205 --> 00:29:17,497
Speaker 1: It's where our, it's the realm of our fears

510
00:29:17,557 --> 00:29:18,399
Speaker 1: and our desires.

511
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,189
Speaker 1: It's the place where the story of our

512
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:24,057
Speaker 1: personal ego abides.

513
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,852
Speaker 1: It's a small little world that the ego

514
00:29:29,454 --> 00:29:30,977
Speaker 1: creates and the ego lives in.

515
00:29:32,746 --> 00:29:35,291
Speaker 1: It's a place of enormous suffering and an

516
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:38,478
Speaker 1: immense experience of inner contraction.

517
00:29:40,366 --> 00:29:41,952
Speaker 1: It's a place of very little inner freedom

518
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:46,634
Speaker 1: and very little love.

519
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:52,555
Speaker 1: It's a place of alienation, isolation and

520
00:29:52,595 --> 00:29:53,176
Speaker 1: separation.

521
00:29:58,065 --> 00:29:59,612
Speaker 1: It's the abode of the small self.

522
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:05,495
Speaker 1: It's the abode of the small self.

523
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:07,078
Speaker 1: So when we make that flip from small self

524
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:14,032
Speaker 1: to big self, from ego to being, the ego,

525
00:30:14,072 --> 00:30:14,975
Speaker 1: suddenly disappears.

526
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:21,607
Speaker 1: The ego's world disappears Suddenly.

527
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:23,517
Speaker 1: It's as if the ego's world never existed,

528
00:30:23,537 --> 00:30:25,706
Speaker 1: and we delight in experiencing a state of

529
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:32,037
Speaker 1: eternal freedom, eternal freedom, freedom

530
00:30:32,057 --> 00:30:34,746
Speaker 1: that is eternal, that is beginningless and

531
00:30:34,826 --> 00:30:36,329
Speaker 1: endless and timeless and formless.

532
00:30:38,493 --> 00:30:40,116
Speaker 1: So when we awaken to the presence of the

533
00:30:40,196 --> 00:30:46,226
Speaker 1: eternal or eternity, so when we awaken to

534
00:30:46,246 --> 00:30:47,089
Speaker 1: the presence of the eternal or eternity, we

535
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:48,292
Speaker 1: experience a profound sense of liberation

536
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:50,257
Speaker 1: that is intoxicating beyond imagination.

537
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,338
Speaker 1: It's a place of such joy that we don't want

538
00:30:53,358 --> 00:30:54,944
Speaker 1: to return from, and this is why men and

539
00:30:54,964 --> 00:30:57,769
Speaker 1: women have been leading the world for

540
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,674
Speaker 1: millennia to be able to abide in the state

541
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:01,415
Speaker 1: of consciousness.

542
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:04,440
Speaker 1: So people have been sitting in caves and

543
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,204
Speaker 1: sitting on mountain tops and sitting in the

544
00:31:07,244 --> 00:31:11,015
Speaker 1: forest and getting away from the world to

545
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:13,724
Speaker 1: experience this kind of glorious, ecstatic

546
00:31:13,764 --> 00:31:14,686
Speaker 1: freedom and happiness.

547
00:31:18,935 --> 00:31:21,981
Speaker 1: So the way to attain the enlightened

548
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:23,604
Speaker 1: awareness of being, or the being

549
00:31:23,644 --> 00:31:29,415
Speaker 1: enlightenment, is through letting go of

550
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:31,859
Speaker 1: anything and everything that's in our way.

551
00:31:35,887 --> 00:31:40,211
Speaker 1: So how this would work is, let's say you're

552
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:49,386
Speaker 1: sitting in meditation, you go very deep,

553
00:31:49,426 --> 00:31:50,928
Speaker 1: you realize in a sudden and immediate way

554
00:31:50,949 --> 00:31:55,016
Speaker 1: that you're attached to something, to a

555
00:31:55,056 --> 00:31:57,407
Speaker 1: painful experience, to a bad relationship,

556
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,637
Speaker 1: to a wrong idea, whatever it is.

557
00:32:02,026 --> 00:32:03,815
Speaker 1: You realize it and you see for yourself

558
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:04,659
Speaker 1: that you're attached to a wrong

559
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:05,804
Speaker 1: relationship, to a wrong idea, whatever it

560
00:32:05,865 --> 00:32:05,905
Speaker 1: is.

561
00:32:06,245 --> 00:32:07,328
Speaker 1: You realize and you see for yourself that

562
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:07,735
Speaker 1: you're attached.

563
00:32:07,698 --> 00:32:07,927
Speaker 1: You can feel it.

564
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:08,887
Speaker 1: You can feel the contractions, you can feel

565
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:10,404
Speaker 1: the tightness.

566
00:32:10,525 --> 00:32:11,369
Speaker 1: So what should you do then?

567
00:32:13,205 --> 00:32:17,808
Speaker 1: All you've got to do is let go In

568
00:32:17,828 --> 00:32:18,953
Speaker 1: approaching being enlightenment.

569
00:32:19,025 --> 00:32:20,110
Speaker 1: All we have to do is let go.

570
00:32:23,165 --> 00:32:27,977
Speaker 1: So the access point to awakening, to being

571
00:32:28,017 --> 00:32:29,448
Speaker 1: enlightenment the enlightenment that the

572
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,448
Speaker 1: Buddhas taught, the enlightenment that

573
00:32:32,468 --> 00:32:37,186
Speaker 1: Ramana Harshi was radiating, the

574
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:40,295
Speaker 1: enlightenment that my teacher taught me is

575
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:41,077
Speaker 1: the being enlightenment.

576
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:42,770
Speaker 1: The way to reach being enlightenment is by

577
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,235
Speaker 1: letting go of anything that's in its way,

578
00:32:44,785 --> 00:32:46,511
Speaker 1: especially our attachment to the mind and

579
00:32:46,552 --> 00:32:47,214
Speaker 1: its contents.

580
00:32:50,766 --> 00:32:55,316
Speaker 1: The mind and its contents that is connected

581
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:58,493
Speaker 1: with the ego is a place of overwhelming

582
00:32:58,533 --> 00:32:59,957
Speaker 1: attachment and identification.

583
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,172
Speaker 1: So you say what do I do about it?

584
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:05,492
Speaker 1: The only thing to do about it is you want

585
00:33:05,512 --> 00:33:05,974
Speaker 1: to be free.

586
00:33:06,225 --> 00:33:07,511
Speaker 1: If you want to be free, it's to let go of

587
00:33:07,591 --> 00:33:07,952
Speaker 1: all of it.

588
00:33:08,465 --> 00:33:15,070
Speaker 1: When, sometime around now and I want to

589
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,955
Speaker 1: make clear to all of you that that's all

590
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,610
Speaker 1: there is to it Isn't it more complicated?

591
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,966
Speaker 1: No, it's not the only thing.

592
00:33:23,986 --> 00:33:24,708
Speaker 1: If you want to awaken to enlightened

593
00:33:24,728 --> 00:33:25,851
Speaker 1: awareness in the context of being

594
00:33:25,911 --> 00:33:28,685
Speaker 1: enlightened, all you have to do.

595
00:33:28,825 --> 00:33:31,608
Speaker 1: All one has to do is to let go of anything

596
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:33,210
Speaker 1: that's in the way.

597
00:33:36,093 --> 00:33:40,458
Speaker 1: What's in the Fear and attachment, fear,

598
00:33:40,538 --> 00:33:46,488
Speaker 1: desire, identification and attachment, fear,

599
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:49,708
Speaker 1: desire, identification and attachment To

600
00:33:49,748 --> 00:33:52,790
Speaker 1: this or to that Doesn't matter what it is,

601
00:33:54,025 --> 00:33:57,666
Speaker 1: it's whatever keeps you unfree, whatever

602
00:33:57,707 --> 00:33:59,951
Speaker 1: keeps you unfree and attached and dug in

603
00:34:00,692 --> 00:34:06,106
Speaker 1: and trapped and spiritually suffocated and

604
00:34:06,307 --> 00:34:07,973
Speaker 1: anything less than totally free and totally

605
00:34:07,993 --> 00:34:08,475
Speaker 1: liberated.

606
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:10,452
Speaker 1: So it needs to be relinquished.

607
00:34:10,745 --> 00:34:11,810
Speaker 1: Our attachment to it needs to be

608
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,412
Speaker 1: relinquished.

609
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,708
Speaker 1: So all we have to do if we want to awaken

610
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:21,133
Speaker 1: to being enlightenment, is to let go of

611
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:22,535
Speaker 1: anything that is in the way.

612
00:34:22,555 --> 00:34:25,740
Speaker 1: That's all we have to do.

613
00:34:25,845 --> 00:34:27,452
Speaker 1: Easier said than done, obviously.

614
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:31,311
Speaker 1: I realize that it might be easier said than

615
00:34:31,351 --> 00:34:35,334
Speaker 1: done, but it is that easy Because when we

616
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:36,566
Speaker 1: think about enlightenment, we want to make

617
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:37,550
Speaker 1: it very complicated.

618
00:34:38,272 --> 00:34:39,215
Speaker 1: There must be more to it.

619
00:34:39,305 --> 00:34:41,470
Speaker 1: There has to be some complex puzzle that I

620
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:41,987
Speaker 1: need to understand here.

621
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:42,533
Speaker 1: There must be more to it.

622
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:42,610
Speaker 1: There has to be some complex puzzle that I

623
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:44,446
Speaker 1: need to understand here.

624
00:34:44,466 --> 00:34:46,371
Speaker 1: There must be some complex metaphysical

625
00:34:47,513 --> 00:34:49,298
Speaker 1: process that I need to understand and I

626
00:34:49,318 --> 00:34:50,569
Speaker 1: need to work through in order to get there

627
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,132
Speaker 1: to say no.

628
00:34:52,618 --> 00:34:54,084
Speaker 1: All you've got to do is let go and

629
00:34:54,124 --> 00:34:55,307
Speaker 1: everything will become clear to you.

630
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:00,559
Speaker 1: So it's the letting go part that's so

631
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,020
Speaker 1: challenging.

632
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,788
Speaker 1: It's the letting go part that's so

633
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:03,028
Speaker 1: challenging.

634
00:35:03,048 --> 00:35:05,232
Speaker 1: But letting go is simply what it is.

635
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:06,894
Speaker 1: There's nothing more to it than what it is.

636
00:35:06,954 --> 00:35:08,116
Speaker 1: Letting go is letting go.

637
00:35:09,118 --> 00:35:10,179
Speaker 1: There's nothing more to it.

638
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,042
Speaker 1: There's nothing more to it than becomes

639
00:35:14,082 --> 00:35:15,623
Speaker 1: apparent to us when we think about what is

640
00:35:15,643 --> 00:35:16,043
Speaker 1: letting go.

641
00:35:17,246 --> 00:35:18,671
Speaker 1: It's letting go of our attachment to

642
00:35:18,731 --> 00:35:19,374
Speaker 1: whatever it is.

643
00:35:21,346 --> 00:35:23,032
Speaker 1: If you let go of attachment, you will be

644
00:35:23,113 --> 00:35:25,692
Speaker 1: free and you will awaken to the ground of

645
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:27,181
Speaker 1: being, and you know exactly what Eckhart

646
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:30,595
Speaker 1: Tolle so passionately speaks about all the

647
00:35:30,635 --> 00:35:30,916
Speaker 1: time.

648
00:35:33,826 --> 00:35:40,972
Speaker 1: So I wanted to emphasize how simple this is

649
00:35:41,293 --> 00:35:42,236
Speaker 1: and how profound it is.

650
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,602
Speaker 1: If you want to awaken to the enlightened

651
00:35:45,622 --> 00:35:49,115
Speaker 1: awareness that the Buddha was calling us to,

652
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,010
Speaker 1: if you want to know what Ramana Maharshi

653
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:56,549
Speaker 1: was speaking about and pointing to, all

654
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:59,676
Speaker 1: you've got to do is let go of your mind,

655
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:01,119
Speaker 1: let your ego.

656
00:36:07,105 --> 00:36:07,606
Speaker 1: Easier said than done.

657
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:08,448
Speaker 1: Sure, it might be easier said than done,

658
00:36:08,468 --> 00:36:09,470
Speaker 1: and it is easier said than done, but in the

659
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,976
Speaker 1: end, that's all there is to it.

660
00:36:12,377 --> 00:36:12,998
Speaker 1: That's my point.

661
00:36:14,846 --> 00:36:15,808
Speaker 1: It couldn't be that simple.

662
00:36:15,928 --> 00:36:16,891
Speaker 1: Yes, it is that simple.

663
00:36:17,953 --> 00:36:19,918
Speaker 1: That's my main point.

664
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:23,071
Speaker 1: You mean, letting go is all there is to it?

665
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:28,357
Speaker 1: Yes, but letting go is hard?

666
00:36:30,893 --> 00:36:34,324
Speaker 1: It might be, but just because letting go is

667
00:36:34,344 --> 00:36:35,470
Speaker 1: hard doesn't mean you can't do it.

668
00:36:40,858 --> 00:36:42,150
Speaker 1: There's something to me.

669
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,741
Speaker 1: There's something to me.

670
00:36:43,761 --> 00:36:48,976
Speaker 1: There's something infinitely compelling, so

671
00:36:49,016 --> 00:36:52,452
Speaker 1: deeply satisfying and gratifying and also

672
00:36:52,552 --> 00:36:55,973
Speaker 1: humiliating, about the radical simplicity

673
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,276
Speaker 1: involved in this whole process.

674
00:36:57,787 --> 00:36:59,152
Speaker 1: You mean, all I've got to do is let go.

675
00:36:59,346 --> 00:37:00,290
Speaker 1: Yes, that's all you've got to do.

676
00:37:01,246 --> 00:37:02,569
Speaker 1: And someone says, well, how do I do that?

677
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:05,555
Speaker 1: I say, well, how do you think?

678
00:37:06,897 --> 00:37:07,398
Speaker 1: Is there something?

679
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:07,678
Speaker 1: I don't.

680
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:08,586
Speaker 1: How do I let go?

681
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:11,510
Speaker 1: Just let go.

682
00:37:14,455 --> 00:37:16,398
Speaker 1: And when people say they don't know how to

683
00:37:16,438 --> 00:37:17,540
Speaker 1: let go, I don't believe them.

684
00:37:20,286 --> 00:37:21,288
Speaker 1: We all know how to let go.

685
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,773
Speaker 1: The question is, are we ready to do it yet?

686
00:37:24,455 --> 00:37:29,335
Speaker 1: Or we might not be ready, and that's a

687
00:37:29,355 --> 00:37:29,817
Speaker 1: different subject.

688
00:37:31,265 --> 00:37:32,246
Speaker 1: But I just want to get everybody to the

689
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:33,667
Speaker 1: point where they recognize that all that's

690
00:37:33,747 --> 00:37:45,516
Speaker 1: involved is the letting go itself.

691
00:37:45,536 --> 00:37:47,077
Speaker 1: So being enlightenment is what's commonly

692
00:37:47,117 --> 00:37:47,817
Speaker 1: understood to be.

693
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:49,519
Speaker 1: When people use the word enlightenment,

694
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:50,559
Speaker 1: that's what they're referring to.

695
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,020
Speaker 1: That's what I'm calling the being

696
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:52,581
Speaker 1: enlightenment.

697
00:37:52,621 --> 00:37:54,322
Speaker 1: But there's another kind of enlightenment

698
00:38:04,014 --> 00:38:05,417
Speaker 1: which is equally valuable and equally

699
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:08,304
Speaker 1: profound, which is relatively new.

700
00:38:13,328 --> 00:38:14,814
Speaker 1: It's the awakening to evolution.

701
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:20,735
Speaker 1: It's awakening to the creative intelligence

702
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:26,416
Speaker 1: that's catalyzing the evolving momentum of

703
00:38:26,436 --> 00:38:27,098
Speaker 1: the cosmos.

704
00:38:30,306 --> 00:38:32,132
Speaker 1: It's awakening to that cosmic intelligence

705
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:35,518
Speaker 1: called Eros, the energy and intelligence

706
00:38:35,538 --> 00:38:37,069
Speaker 1: that created the universe and is creating

707
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:37,470
Speaker 1: it right now.

708
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,751
Speaker 1: It's awakening directly to it.

709
00:38:40,707 --> 00:38:42,032
Speaker 1: It affords us a different kind of

710
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:42,554
Speaker 1: enlightenment.

711
00:38:42,645 --> 00:38:46,234
Speaker 1: It's awakening to this creative

712
00:38:46,274 --> 00:38:50,691
Speaker 1: intelligence, the God consciousness, the

713
00:38:50,812 --> 00:38:51,735
Speaker 1: creative intelligence.

714
00:38:51,805 --> 00:38:53,872
Speaker 1: That's the God consciousness that compelled

715
00:38:53,912 --> 00:38:55,428
Speaker 1: the universe into existence and that's

716
00:38:55,448 --> 00:38:57,414
Speaker 1: compelling us to exist now.

717
00:38:59,065 --> 00:39:03,245
Speaker 1: That's compelling us forward in time, it's

718
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:04,732
Speaker 1: the source of all creativity.

719
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:08,890
Speaker 1: That's why I call it evolutionary

720
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:09,292
Speaker 1: enlightenment.

721
00:39:09,526 --> 00:39:10,892
Speaker 1: It's the awakening to evolution.

722
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:14,975
Speaker 1: And the great realizers, like the Catholic

723
00:39:15,016 --> 00:39:17,712
Speaker 1: priest Thierry de Chardin, the great

724
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:20,531
Speaker 1: Eastern realizer and genius, sri Aurobindo,

725
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,877
Speaker 1: awakened evolution.

726
00:39:34,697 --> 00:39:35,720
Speaker 1: And this is a different kind of

727
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,321
Speaker 1: enlightenment.

728
00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:41,842
Speaker 1: This, in this enlightenment, we become

729
00:39:42,063 --> 00:39:42,545
Speaker 1: aware of this.

730
00:39:42,825 --> 00:39:43,488
Speaker 1: The momentum, the living, vibrating

731
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:45,673
Speaker 1: momentum of the creative intelligence that

732
00:39:45,714 --> 00:39:47,247
Speaker 1: gave rise to the universe and it's giving

733
00:39:47,287 --> 00:39:48,111
Speaker 1: rise to it right now.

734
00:39:49,445 --> 00:39:54,688
Speaker 1: That creative intelligence is moving, is on

735
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:59,770
Speaker 1: a journey of becoming and it's compelling

736
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,814
Speaker 1: all of us towards the future.

737
00:40:05,146 --> 00:40:06,931
Speaker 1: And the experience of this kind of cosmic,

738
00:40:07,131 --> 00:40:08,895
Speaker 1: creative intelligence is not peace.

739
00:40:08,975 --> 00:40:09,938
Speaker 1: It doesn't feel peaceful.

740
00:40:11,165 --> 00:40:13,273
Speaker 1: It's the experience of an ecstatic creative

741
00:40:13,393 --> 00:40:13,835
Speaker 1: urgency.

742
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:17,342
Speaker 1: It's the experience of an ecstatic creative

743
00:40:17,423 --> 00:40:21,613
Speaker 1: urgency that's compelling us at an

744
00:40:21,773 --> 00:40:24,398
Speaker 1: unthinkable momentum towards the future.

745
00:40:33,025 --> 00:40:34,991
Speaker 1: So the most profound acts of creativity

746
00:40:36,014 --> 00:40:40,836
Speaker 1: occur because of this momentum that I'm

747
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:41,477
Speaker 1: speaking about.

748
00:40:43,311 --> 00:40:46,102
Speaker 1: Because of this momentum that I'm speaking

749
00:40:46,122 --> 00:40:47,106
Speaker 1: about, all creativity is possible only

750
00:40:47,146 --> 00:40:47,588
Speaker 1: because of that.

751
00:40:47,608 --> 00:40:48,972
Speaker 1: And so when you awaken to this creative

752
00:40:48,993 --> 00:40:52,753
Speaker 1: intelligence itself directly, we experience

753
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:56,048
Speaker 1: an ecstatic urgency and an overwhelming

754
00:40:56,088 --> 00:40:58,415
Speaker 1: sense of positivity.

755
00:40:58,886 --> 00:41:00,533
Speaker 1: There's a sense that anything is possible,

756
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:01,694
Speaker 1: all things are possible.

757
00:41:01,714 --> 00:41:03,005
Speaker 1: All things are possible.

758
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:05,290
Speaker 1: All things are possible because we're awake

759
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,335
Speaker 1: to a sense of infinite greater potential,

760
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:09,869
Speaker 1: that is, one with the source of creation

761
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:10,350
Speaker 1: itself.

762
00:41:12,665 --> 00:41:13,771
Speaker 1: We become conscious of it.

763
00:41:14,093 --> 00:41:15,239
Speaker 1: Becoming conscious of it is what

764
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:16,886
Speaker 1: evolutionary enlightenment is all about.

765
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,937
Speaker 1: It's awakening to us a tremendous power.

766
00:41:27,158 --> 00:41:32,067
Speaker 1: Tremendous power, tremendous freedom, and

767
00:41:32,148 --> 00:41:34,450
Speaker 1: one experiences ecstasy because all things

768
00:41:35,011 --> 00:41:35,771
Speaker 1: feel possible.

769
00:41:36,753 --> 00:41:39,556
Speaker 1: When all things feel possible, when all

770
00:41:39,576 --> 00:41:41,077
Speaker 1: things feel possible creatively, you feel

771
00:41:41,278 --> 00:41:41,858
Speaker 1: unbound.

772
00:41:42,219 --> 00:41:47,464
Speaker 1: Unbound, it's a sense of unlimited

773
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:47,905
Speaker 1: potential.

774
00:41:48,226 --> 00:41:50,075
Speaker 1: It's the conscious experience and awakening

775
00:41:50,115 --> 00:41:52,064
Speaker 1: to the infinite potential that's driving

776
00:41:52,085 --> 00:42:09,881
Speaker 1: this entire process.

777
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:12,003
Speaker 1: Like so, you realize that what's compelling

778
00:42:12,603 --> 00:42:14,305
Speaker 1: the energy and intelligence that's creating

779
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,948
Speaker 1: the universe and compelling the universe to

780
00:42:16,008 --> 00:42:20,899
Speaker 1: exist, its nature is pure positivity, and

781
00:42:20,945 --> 00:42:23,392
Speaker 1: when you experience that pure positivity

782
00:42:23,452 --> 00:42:26,448
Speaker 1: directly, you'll know it Because it'll be

783
00:42:26,488 --> 00:42:27,832
Speaker 1: the deepest and most profound experience

784
00:42:27,852 --> 00:42:28,454
Speaker 1: you've ever had.

785
00:42:32,086 --> 00:42:33,692
Speaker 1: When that happens, we know that to exist is

786
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:33,993
Speaker 1: good.

787
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,372
Speaker 1: We know that when God created the universe

788
00:42:37,226 --> 00:42:39,046
Speaker 1: it was a big yes, and it still is and that

789
00:42:39,066 --> 00:42:40,532
Speaker 1: changes your life forever.

790
00:42:44,226 --> 00:42:46,392
Speaker 1: So, in this evolutionary enlightenment

791
00:42:46,573 --> 00:42:50,647
Speaker 1: versus the being enlightenment, how do we

792
00:42:50,688 --> 00:42:52,113
Speaker 1: awaken to evolutionary enlightenment?

793
00:42:52,165 --> 00:42:56,027
Speaker 1: By becoming very interested in it, by

794
00:42:56,067 --> 00:42:57,252
Speaker 1: becoming very interested in it.

795
00:43:00,426 --> 00:43:03,635
Speaker 1: But in order to catalyze the becoming

796
00:43:03,715 --> 00:43:05,490
Speaker 1: enlightenment, the evolutionary becoming

797
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:11,167
Speaker 1: enlightenment is, we need to realize it, we

798
00:43:11,187 --> 00:43:15,587
Speaker 1: need to have a realization of it and then,

799
00:43:15,828 --> 00:43:20,098
Speaker 1: in order to catalyze its deepening,

800
00:43:21,405 --> 00:43:24,853
Speaker 1: catalyze its continuity, we need to respond

801
00:43:25,638 --> 00:43:27,427
Speaker 1: fearlessly and passionately to what we've

802
00:43:27,468 --> 00:43:31,352
Speaker 1: realized In evolutionary awakening and in

803
00:43:31,412 --> 00:43:32,656
Speaker 1: evolutionary enlightenment.

804
00:43:33,885 --> 00:43:35,973
Speaker 1: We need to realize and respond.

805
00:43:38,588 --> 00:43:40,842
Speaker 1: We need to awaken to this cosmic energy and

806
00:43:40,882 --> 00:43:43,653
Speaker 1: intelligence and then respond to what

807
00:43:43,693 --> 00:43:47,774
Speaker 1: you've realized, realize and awaken to this

808
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,619
Speaker 1: creative intelligence that's catalyzing the

809
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:54,447
Speaker 1: momentum of the evolving cosmos, and

810
00:43:54,527 --> 00:43:56,152
Speaker 1: respond to it.

811
00:43:56,253 --> 00:43:56,855
Speaker 1: Respond.

812
00:43:57,845 --> 00:44:01,056
Speaker 1: We have to continuously realize and respond.

813
00:44:04,788 --> 00:44:06,434
Speaker 1: If we realize it, we don't respond to it,

814
00:44:07,328 --> 00:44:08,413
Speaker 1: it will fall away from us.

815
00:44:11,013 --> 00:44:14,467
Speaker 1: If you realize and awaken to evolution, if

816
00:44:14,507 --> 00:44:17,991
Speaker 1: you awaken to the evolutionary impulse and

817
00:44:18,011 --> 00:44:21,572
Speaker 1: don't respond to it, the tangible sense of

818
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:22,895
Speaker 1: the evolutionary impulse will fall away

819
00:44:22,935 --> 00:44:23,196
Speaker 1: from you.

820
00:44:25,386 --> 00:44:27,531
Speaker 1: But if you realize it and respond to it,

821
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:34,010
Speaker 1: act from it, its vibration will get

822
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:34,853
Speaker 1: stronger within you.

823
00:44:36,986 --> 00:44:39,133
Speaker 1: And if you continue to realize and respond

824
00:44:39,193 --> 00:44:40,925
Speaker 1: to what you've been realizing, its

825
00:44:40,966 --> 00:44:42,752
Speaker 1: vibration will get stronger and stronger

826
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:43,274
Speaker 1: and stronger.

827
00:44:45,566 --> 00:44:50,216
Speaker 1: So what's very, very interesting is that in

828
00:44:50,296 --> 00:44:52,588
Speaker 1: being enlightenment, in the enlightenment

829
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:54,254
Speaker 1: in which we awaken to timeless, formless,

830
00:44:54,294 --> 00:44:57,711
Speaker 1: beginningless and endless being, we need to

831
00:44:57,751 --> 00:45:04,107
Speaker 1: realize being and let go, awaken to

832
00:45:04,147 --> 00:45:05,712
Speaker 1: timeless, formless, beginningless and

833
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:09,573
Speaker 1: endless eternal being and let go and

834
00:45:09,613 --> 00:45:12,369
Speaker 1: continue to let go To have nothing, know

835
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,347
Speaker 1: nothing and be no one, to continue to let

836
00:45:14,387 --> 00:45:17,816
Speaker 1: go eternally, continuously, again and again

837
00:45:17,876 --> 00:45:18,217
Speaker 1: and again.

838
00:45:18,325 --> 00:45:19,994
Speaker 1: Letting go is freedom.

839
00:45:20,765 --> 00:45:22,212
Speaker 1: In being enlightenment, letting go is

840
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:22,635
Speaker 1: freedom.

841
00:45:23,841 --> 00:45:25,630
Speaker 1: I repeat, in being enlightenment, letting

842
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:26,273
Speaker 1: go is freedom.

843
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,488
Speaker 1: But in evolutionary enlightenment or

844
00:45:29,508 --> 00:45:34,612
Speaker 1: becoming enlightenment, freedom only comes

845
00:45:34,653 --> 00:45:37,650
Speaker 1: from responding or the response to what

846
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:38,394
Speaker 1: we've realized.

847
00:45:40,062 --> 00:45:41,850
Speaker 1: In becoming enlightenment, it's realize and

848
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:45,291
Speaker 1: respond, realize and act, realize and take

849
00:45:45,431 --> 00:45:48,277
Speaker 1: action, realize and take action, realize

850
00:45:48,317 --> 00:45:48,919
Speaker 1: and take action.

851
00:45:51,507 --> 00:45:53,498
Speaker 1: The only way the universe will continue to

852
00:45:53,538 --> 00:45:56,490
Speaker 1: evolve at the level of consciousness is

853
00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:01,807
Speaker 1: when human beings realize, awaken to and

854
00:46:01,827 --> 00:46:03,172
Speaker 1: realize the evolutionary impulse and

855
00:46:03,232 --> 00:46:09,349
Speaker 1: respond to the gift of incarnation in that

856
00:46:09,409 --> 00:46:09,890
Speaker 1: knowledge.

857
00:46:12,715 --> 00:46:14,859
Speaker 1: Then we need to realize and respond to what

858
00:46:14,899 --> 00:46:18,995
Speaker 1: we've realized again and again and again

859
00:46:19,216 --> 00:46:19,597
Speaker 1: and again.

860
00:46:20,186 --> 00:46:22,847
Speaker 1: And if we continue to respond and our

861
00:46:22,887 --> 00:46:24,667
Speaker 1: responses are powerful and are coming from

862
00:46:24,707 --> 00:46:27,989
Speaker 1: the source, then the universe will evolve

863
00:46:28,792 --> 00:46:32,287
Speaker 1: and be changed and affected as a result of

864
00:46:32,367 --> 00:46:32,987
Speaker 1: our response.

865
00:46:42,956 --> 00:46:45,058
Speaker 1: The more I in evolutionary enlightenment,

866
00:46:45,078 --> 00:46:47,800
Speaker 1: the more I realize and respond, and the

867
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:56,146
Speaker 1: more you realize and respond, the more the

868
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:57,573
Speaker 1: interior of the universe will be affected

869
00:46:57,593 --> 00:47:00,405
Speaker 1: by our realization.

870
00:47:01,266 --> 00:47:02,789
Speaker 1: So the profound distinction I wanted to

871
00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:07,538
Speaker 1: make in this talk was this very simple

872
00:47:07,598 --> 00:47:10,311
Speaker 1: teaching that makes this profound

873
00:47:10,351 --> 00:47:12,256
Speaker 1: distinction, which is that in being,

874
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:14,448
Speaker 1: enlightenment enlightenment of the Buddha,

875
00:47:14,468 --> 00:47:15,993
Speaker 1: the enlightenment of Ramamaharshi, the

876
00:47:16,013 --> 00:47:19,089
Speaker 1: enlightenment of Akartali is directly

877
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:22,963
Speaker 1: experienced when we realize and let go of

878
00:47:22,983 --> 00:47:24,971
Speaker 1: the mind and of the fears and desires of

879
00:47:24,991 --> 00:47:27,549
Speaker 1: the separate personality, realize and let

880
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:27,750
Speaker 1: go.

881
00:47:29,286 --> 00:47:30,773
Speaker 1: I want to be enlightened, then let go.

882
00:47:32,947 --> 00:47:34,947
Speaker 1: I want to know what the Buddha did, I want

883
00:47:34,967 --> 00:47:36,090
Speaker 1: to know what the Buddha did.

884
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:38,336
Speaker 1: So let go Now.

885
00:47:39,486 --> 00:47:40,290
Speaker 1: Let go now.

886
00:47:41,746 --> 00:47:42,487
Speaker 1: Let go now.

887
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:45,956
Speaker 1: Let go of the story now, let go of your

888
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:46,778
Speaker 1: mind now.

889
00:47:50,105 --> 00:47:51,208
Speaker 1: And then, of course, there's the ego's

890
00:47:51,248 --> 00:47:51,809
Speaker 1: reluctance.

891
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:55,518
Speaker 1: And until the ego's reluctance is defeated

892
00:47:55,578 --> 00:47:58,030
Speaker 1: or transcended, the one access to being

893
00:47:58,070 --> 00:47:59,292
Speaker 1: won't be granted.

894
00:48:00,355 --> 00:48:01,777
Speaker 1: But when you transcend your own ego's

895
00:48:01,818 --> 00:48:04,991
Speaker 1: reluctance, then you find access to the

896
00:48:05,031 --> 00:48:08,650
Speaker 1: ground of being and you get an infinite

897
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:09,092
Speaker 1: reward.

898
00:48:11,006 --> 00:48:12,934
Speaker 1: It is eternal peace and eternal freedom,

899
00:48:14,145 --> 00:48:15,451
Speaker 1: the freedom of knowing you've never been

900
00:48:15,491 --> 00:48:15,792
Speaker 1: born.

901
00:48:16,765 --> 00:48:18,049
Speaker 1: And if you know you've never been born, you

902
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:18,991
Speaker 1: know you're never going to die.

903
00:48:20,115 --> 00:48:23,127
Speaker 1: That's the idea and it's also the

904
00:48:23,188 --> 00:48:32,985
Speaker 1: experience, the gift of evolutionary, the

905
00:48:33,025 --> 00:48:34,572
Speaker 1: gift that evolutionary enlightenment gives

906
00:48:34,632 --> 00:48:36,372
Speaker 1: us, awakening to the evolutionary impulses,

907
00:48:36,505 --> 00:48:39,013
Speaker 1: the gift of knowing who I am and why I'm

908
00:48:39,073 --> 00:48:39,234
Speaker 1: here.

909
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:43,072
Speaker 1: When you awaken to the evolutionary impulse,

910
00:48:43,165 --> 00:48:46,883
Speaker 1: you realize I am the energy and

911
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:48,430
Speaker 1: intelligence that created the universe,

912
00:48:49,685 --> 00:48:51,320
Speaker 1: awakening to itself through the body-mind

913
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,111
Speaker 1: personality of, in my case, andrew.

914
00:48:55,067 --> 00:48:56,431
Speaker 1: I am the energy and intelligence that

915
00:48:56,452 --> 00:48:58,171
Speaker 1: created the universe, awakening to itself

916
00:48:58,775 --> 00:49:00,887
Speaker 1: through the body-mind personality of Andrew,

917
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:02,834
Speaker 1: of my very own self.

918
00:49:04,485 --> 00:49:05,851
Speaker 1: And now I've discovered the internet

919
00:49:05,871 --> 00:49:07,409
Speaker 1: context from my presence here in the

920
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:07,891
Speaker 1: universe.

921
00:49:09,785 --> 00:49:10,890
Speaker 1: I'm the energy and intelligence that

922
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:13,511
Speaker 1: created the universe and I'm here, through

923
00:49:13,531 --> 00:49:15,125
Speaker 1: the vehicle of this body-mind and

924
00:49:15,145 --> 00:49:16,590
Speaker 1: personality, to create the future.

925
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:20,948
Speaker 1: That's my reason to exist, from the

926
00:49:20,968 --> 00:49:21,905
Speaker 1: perspective of enlightenment.

927
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,591
Speaker 1: I'm not here to have and to get and to

928
00:49:23,611 --> 00:49:24,614
Speaker 1: become for myself.

929
00:49:26,787 --> 00:49:28,537
Speaker 1: I'm not here to narcissistically and

930
00:49:28,597 --> 00:49:32,793
Speaker 1: egotistically live this human incarnation

931
00:49:32,954 --> 00:49:35,030
Speaker 1: for myself, have, get and become for me.

932
00:49:35,967 --> 00:49:38,502
Speaker 1: I'm here to help co-create the interior of

933
00:49:38,522 --> 00:49:40,365
Speaker 1: the universe as the energy and intelligence

934
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:42,626
Speaker 1: that gave rise to it in the first place.

935
00:49:42,726 --> 00:49:44,851
Speaker 1: That's why I exist, that's why I exist,

936
00:49:45,332 --> 00:49:47,518
Speaker 1: that's why I exist and that's why you exist.

937
00:49:48,187 --> 00:49:49,912
Speaker 1: And you know that when you realize that,

938
00:49:49,932 --> 00:49:51,657
Speaker 1: when you recognize that changes your life,

939
00:49:53,989 --> 00:49:56,013
Speaker 1: so many smart, intelligent, sensitive,

940
00:49:56,073 --> 00:49:58,658
Speaker 1: thoughtful, intelligent people suffer so

941
00:49:58,698 --> 00:50:03,442
Speaker 1: much despair and lean towards nihilistic

942
00:50:03,503 --> 00:50:05,028
Speaker 1: inclinations because they don't know why

943
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:05,670
Speaker 1: they exist.

944
00:50:06,032 --> 00:50:06,895
Speaker 1: They don't know why they're here.

945
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:08,351
Speaker 1: They don't know why the universe exists.

946
00:50:09,726 --> 00:50:14,236
Speaker 1: So if you're here in this frail body and

947
00:50:14,276 --> 00:50:17,189
Speaker 1: sensitive mind and you don't know why

948
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,508
Speaker 1: you're here, you live in a state of

949
00:50:19,588 --> 00:50:21,333
Speaker 1: ambivalence about being here.

950
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:24,549
Speaker 1: But when you have no doubt who you are, you

951
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:29,337
Speaker 1: have no doubt why you're here, you

952
00:50:29,717 --> 00:50:32,848
Speaker 1: experience enormous gratitude at the

953
00:50:32,868 --> 00:50:35,893
Speaker 1: privilege of being able to play such an

954
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:37,396
Speaker 1: important part in this whole process.

955
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:41,069
Speaker 1: I know who I am and I know why I'm here.

956
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:42,632
Speaker 1: That changes everything.

957
00:50:47,703 --> 00:50:49,706
Speaker 1: So being enlightenment is realize and let

958
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:56,974
Speaker 1: go Infinitely, let go eternally and

959
00:50:57,014 --> 00:50:57,455
Speaker 1: infinitely.

960
00:50:58,195 --> 00:50:59,657
Speaker 1: Becoming enlightenment is realize and

961
00:50:59,697 --> 00:51:00,217
Speaker 1: respond.

962
00:51:00,578 --> 00:51:07,633
Speaker 1: When Now, realize and let go, realize and

963
00:51:07,653 --> 00:51:07,833
Speaker 1: respond.

964
00:51:07,853 --> 00:51:08,495
Speaker 1: So think about that.

965
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:12,936
Speaker 1: That's very easy to understand and, as I

966
00:51:12,976 --> 00:51:15,187
Speaker 1: said at the beginning of my talk, I want to

967
00:51:15,207 --> 00:51:16,873
Speaker 1: help demystify how all this works.

968
00:51:20,346 --> 00:51:22,169
Speaker 1: So you're telling me, if I want to know

969
00:51:22,189 --> 00:51:24,811
Speaker 1: what the Buddha knew, I want to awaken to

970
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,195
Speaker 1: the ground of being that Eckhart Tolle

971
00:51:26,215 --> 00:51:27,746
Speaker 1: speaks about so passionately, that all I

972
00:51:27,766 --> 00:51:30,374
Speaker 1: need to do is realize and let go.

973
00:51:30,935 --> 00:51:35,195
Speaker 1: Yes, of my fear and attachment.

974
00:51:35,376 --> 00:51:37,933
Speaker 1: Yes, you mean there's nothing more involved.

975
00:51:37,953 --> 00:51:40,773
Speaker 1: No, anybody can do it.

976
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:42,348
Speaker 1: Yes, even I can do it.

977
00:51:42,368 --> 00:51:43,129
Speaker 1: Yes, even I can do it.

978
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:49,630
Speaker 1: Yes, beautiful, we end up having no excuses

979
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:50,092
Speaker 1: anymore.

980
00:51:51,565 --> 00:51:52,690
Speaker 1: Why aren't you enlightened yet?

981
00:51:57,225 --> 00:51:59,711
Speaker 1: If it's that easy, we all should be well on

982
00:51:59,751 --> 00:52:00,172
Speaker 1: our way now.

983
00:52:02,626 --> 00:52:04,172
Speaker 1: It's really not any more complicated than

984
00:52:04,192 --> 00:52:04,754
Speaker 1: what I'm saying.

985
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:08,314
Speaker 1: It seems complicated from the ego's

986
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:10,309
Speaker 1: perspective, from the part of you that has

987
00:52:10,369 --> 00:52:11,614
Speaker 1: no interest in enlightenment in the first

988
00:52:11,654 --> 00:52:11,814
Speaker 1: place.

989
00:52:11,905 --> 00:52:14,687
Speaker 1: It seems endlessly complicated From the

990
00:52:14,727 --> 00:52:16,494
Speaker 1: part of you that always only wanted that.

991
00:52:16,706 --> 00:52:18,252
Speaker 1: It's very immediate and very simple and

992
00:52:18,272 --> 00:52:18,794
Speaker 1: very direct.

993
00:52:19,885 --> 00:52:21,591
Speaker 1: Being enlightenment is realize and let go.

994
00:52:22,835 --> 00:52:24,400
Speaker 1: Becoming enlightenment is realize and let

995
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:24,460
Speaker 1: go.

996
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,280
Speaker 1: Becoming enlightenment is realize and

997
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,643
Speaker 1: respond, realize and respond, realize and

998
00:52:32,663 --> 00:52:32,905
Speaker 1: respond.

999
00:52:33,546 --> 00:52:47,416
Speaker 1: And once you understand the way being

1000
00:52:47,436 --> 00:52:49,303
Speaker 1: enlightenment works together with becoming

1001
00:52:49,343 --> 00:52:53,107
Speaker 1: enlightenment, then this information of

1002
00:52:53,127 --> 00:53:02,924
Speaker 1: realizing and letting go and realizing and

1003
00:53:02,944 --> 00:53:03,565
Speaker 1: responding becomes very useful.

1004
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:04,775
Speaker 1: Now, what I'm describing to you needs to be.

1005
00:53:04,795 --> 00:53:05,604
Speaker 1: Remember what I said before.

1006
00:53:05,966 --> 00:53:10,637
Speaker 1: If we want to cultivate a very deep access

1007
00:53:11,029 --> 00:53:12,365
Speaker 1: to these higher states of consciousness,

1008
00:53:12,546 --> 00:53:14,152
Speaker 1: it's something we need to be working on

1009
00:53:16,093 --> 00:53:18,805
Speaker 1: consistently, continuously, perpetually,

1010
00:53:18,906 --> 00:53:20,462
Speaker 1: just like a master musician would be

1011
00:53:20,483 --> 00:53:26,096
Speaker 1: working on their musical facility.

1012
00:53:29,786 --> 00:53:34,514
Speaker 1: Some musicians practice Eight hours a day,

1013
00:53:34,555 --> 00:53:35,217
Speaker 1: ten hours a day.

1014
00:53:36,611 --> 00:53:38,659
Speaker 1: I think about this stuff sixteen hours a

1015
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:38,859
Speaker 1: day.

1016
00:53:40,591 --> 00:53:43,974
Speaker 1: It's always in my mind, sometimes with more

1017
00:53:43,994 --> 00:53:46,261
Speaker 1: intensity, sometimes with less intensity,

1018
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:47,957
Speaker 1: but this never leaves my consciousness

1019
00:53:49,531 --> 00:53:50,516
Speaker 1: Because I'm living for this.

1020
00:53:52,431 --> 00:53:53,616
Speaker 1: Nobody's forcing me to do it.

1021
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:57,479
Speaker 1: This is what I've chosen to give my life to,

1022
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:01,878
Speaker 1: so it's my eternal obsession.

1023
00:54:05,594 --> 00:54:06,477
Speaker 1: So can we learn?

1024
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:11,278
Speaker 1: So my understanding of living a spiritual

1025
00:54:11,298 --> 00:54:16,253
Speaker 1: life in earnest, in the context of

1026
00:54:16,293 --> 00:54:21,952
Speaker 1: awakening to enlightened awareness, is we

1027
00:54:21,972 --> 00:54:23,858
Speaker 1: want to all perpetually work on realizing

1028
00:54:23,918 --> 00:54:24,540
Speaker 1: and letting go.

1029
00:54:27,835 --> 00:54:31,553
Speaker 1: Realizing and letting go every day.

1030
00:54:32,075 --> 00:54:33,852
Speaker 1: Realizing and letting go every day.

1031
00:54:34,133 --> 00:54:36,476
Speaker 1: Realizing and letting go, continuing to

1032
00:54:36,557 --> 00:54:38,048
Speaker 1: realize and let go so we get better and

1033
00:54:38,068 --> 00:54:38,571
Speaker 1: better at it.

1034
00:54:39,893 --> 00:54:41,596
Speaker 1: The better added you, the better out.

1035
00:54:41,636 --> 00:54:48,629
Speaker 1: If you get, the more authentic, the more

1036
00:54:48,649 --> 00:54:50,112
Speaker 1: truly authentic your enlightenment will

1037
00:54:50,152 --> 00:54:50,713
Speaker 1: appear to be.

1038
00:54:52,277 --> 00:54:53,219
Speaker 1: But you can't fake this.

1039
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:56,947
Speaker 1: I guess some people can, some people do,

1040
00:54:57,348 --> 00:54:59,192
Speaker 1: but you can't really fake it because if you

1041
00:54:59,372 --> 00:55:05,808
Speaker 1: are truly free, you realize the natural

1042
00:55:05,848 --> 00:55:06,069
Speaker 1: state.

1043
00:55:06,089 --> 00:55:11,300
Speaker 1: If you realize the natural state, you will

1044
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,027
Speaker 1: manifest and express lightness of being.

1045
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,658
Speaker 1: One wonderful Dutch spiritual teacher once

1046
00:55:18,758 --> 00:55:21,235
Speaker 1: told me many years ago.

1047
00:55:21,275 --> 00:55:23,157
Speaker 1: He said enlightenment is lightness of being.

1048
00:55:24,751 --> 00:55:27,520
Speaker 1: Enlightenment is lightness of being,

1049
00:55:27,971 --> 00:55:29,116
Speaker 1: lightness of your being.

1050
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:33,714
Speaker 1: So the enlightened awareness is the

1051
00:55:33,775 --> 00:55:35,340
Speaker 1: experience of lightness of being.

1052
00:55:38,095 --> 00:55:39,258
Speaker 1: If you're in the presence of someone who's

1053
00:55:39,278 --> 00:55:42,091
Speaker 1: awakened to enlightened awareness, their

1054
00:55:42,111 --> 00:55:47,073
Speaker 1: presence feels like lightness of being Joy,

1055
00:55:47,214 --> 00:55:48,037
Speaker 1: full of joy.

1056
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,438
Speaker 1: Lightness of being is joyful, full of joy,

1057
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:52,853
Speaker 1: lightness of being.

1058
00:55:52,893 --> 00:55:54,158
Speaker 1: Enlightenment is lightness of being.

1059
00:55:55,732 --> 00:55:59,378
Speaker 1: So can we practice every day, realizing the

1060
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:00,402
Speaker 1: awakening and realization.

1061
00:56:00,422 --> 00:56:01,887
Speaker 1: Enlightenment is lightness of being.

1062
00:56:01,907 --> 00:56:03,734
Speaker 1: So can we practice every day, realizing the

1063
00:56:03,754 --> 00:56:04,524
Speaker 1: awakening and realization of timeless,

1064
00:56:04,544 --> 00:56:05,872
Speaker 1: formless, beginningless and endless eternal

1065
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:08,821
Speaker 1: being and let go.

1066
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:11,855
Speaker 1: Can we practice that every day?

1067
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:15,312
Speaker 1: Can you do that Every day?

1068
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,162
Speaker 1: Work on this letting process of letting go

1069
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:17,751
Speaker 1: of the mind Every day.

1070
00:56:17,696 --> 00:56:18,080
Speaker 1: Working on the process of letting go of the

1071
00:56:18,025 --> 00:56:19,826
Speaker 1: mind every day.

1072
00:56:19,866 --> 00:56:21,227
Speaker 1: Working on the process of letting go of the

1073
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:24,699
Speaker 1: mind every day, working on it becoming

1074
00:56:24,779 --> 00:56:26,406
Speaker 1: better and better at it, becoming a master.

1075
00:56:26,815 --> 00:56:28,069
Speaker 1: Work towards becoming a master.

1076
00:56:34,062 --> 00:56:37,610
Speaker 1: You mean I have to work at this, sorry.

1077
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:41,955
Speaker 1: And can we work every day on?

1078
00:56:41,975 --> 00:56:43,797
Speaker 1: You mean I have to work at this, sorry.

1079
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,118
Speaker 1: And can we work every day on cultivating

1080
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:48,502
Speaker 1: our capacity to be a living manifestation

1081
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:50,444
Speaker 1: and expression of the authentic self, the

1082
00:56:50,504 --> 00:56:52,186
Speaker 1: evolutionary impulse in human form.

1083
00:56:56,611 --> 00:56:58,517
Speaker 1: I am the energy and intelligence that

1084
00:56:58,537 --> 00:56:59,460
Speaker 1: created the universe and is creating the

1085
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,283
Speaker 1: universe, awakening to itself in the form

1086
00:57:00,303 --> 00:57:01,487
Speaker 1: of this body, mind and personality.

1087
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:05,521
Speaker 1: Can I realize my evolutionary potential?

1088
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:07,935
Speaker 1: Can I realize my evolutionary nature and

1089
00:57:07,976 --> 00:57:09,641
Speaker 1: respond to it every day?

1090
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,535
Speaker 1: Can I realize my evolutionary nature and

1091
00:57:11,575 --> 00:57:12,719
Speaker 1: respond to it every day?

1092
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:15,076
Speaker 1: Can I realize my evolutionary nature and

1093
00:57:15,116 --> 00:57:17,713
Speaker 1: respond to it every day, as we continually

1094
00:57:17,754 --> 00:57:19,290
Speaker 1: respond to our evolutionary potential, it

1095
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,937
Speaker 1: gets stronger and stronger and stronger.

1096
00:57:28,872 --> 00:57:35,436
Speaker 1: So then the path becomes, in this case, of

1097
00:57:35,637 --> 00:57:36,620
Speaker 1: evolutionary enlightenment.

1098
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,351
Speaker 1: Would be the practice of being

1099
00:57:38,278 --> 00:57:39,176
Speaker 1: enlightenment, be the practice of being

1100
00:57:39,103 --> 00:57:40,168
Speaker 1: enlightenment and the practice of becoming

1101
00:57:40,188 --> 00:57:42,976
Speaker 1: enlightenment, which simply means to

1102
00:57:43,036 --> 00:57:48,415
Speaker 1: realize every day and let go Every day,

1103
00:57:51,471 --> 00:57:52,837
Speaker 1: hopefully, more and more and more,

1104
00:57:55,911 --> 00:57:58,539
Speaker 1: hopefully, of the big things that keep us

1105
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:01,228
Speaker 1: stuck and bound and trapped and unfree.

1106
00:58:02,273 --> 00:58:03,739
Speaker 1: Letting go every day, more and more.

1107
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:06,494
Speaker 1: Because the way this works is the more you

1108
00:58:06,514 --> 00:58:09,619
Speaker 1: let go, the easier it becomes to let go,

1109
00:58:15,442 --> 00:58:16,672
Speaker 1: and the more you let go, the more you're

1110
00:58:16,692 --> 00:58:18,940
Speaker 1: going to want to let go, because letting go

1111
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,145
Speaker 1: feels good, feels great, and the more you

1112
00:58:20,165 --> 00:58:21,109
Speaker 1: let go, the more you're going to want to

1113
00:58:21,129 --> 00:58:23,972
Speaker 1: let go, because letting go feels good,

1114
00:58:23,992 --> 00:58:27,358
Speaker 1: feels great, feels free.

1115
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,941
Speaker 1: And the kind of freedom I'm speaking about

1116
00:58:29,362 --> 00:58:35,834
Speaker 1: can't be measured, because we're going from

1117
00:58:35,854 --> 00:58:36,661
Speaker 1: a relative to an absolute context and we

1118
00:58:36,681 --> 00:58:37,407
Speaker 1: make that flip from a relative to an

1119
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:37,790
Speaker 1: absolute context.

1120
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,676
Speaker 1: You're entering into a zone which there's,

1121
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:50,194
Speaker 1: no, you can't compare, it's off the scale.

1122
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:54,095
Speaker 1: And in the same way, in the evolutionary

1123
00:58:54,115 --> 00:58:54,497
Speaker 1: context.

1124
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:56,577
Speaker 1: Can I everyday realize and respond?

1125
00:58:59,233 --> 00:59:00,537
Speaker 1: Can I learn how to respond with more

1126
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:03,976
Speaker 1: courage, with more fearless conviction,

1127
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:10,062
Speaker 1: with more inspiration?

1128
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:13,956
Speaker 1: How inspired are you?

1129
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:17,815
Speaker 1: Are you an inspired, evolutionarily

1130
00:59:17,855 --> 00:59:18,737
Speaker 1: awakened soul?

1131
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:22,471
Speaker 1: If your soul has awakened to evolution,

1132
00:59:22,511 --> 00:59:24,637
Speaker 1: that means you are vibrating with the

1133
00:59:24,697 --> 00:59:26,382
Speaker 1: inspiration of the evolutionary impulse.

1134
00:59:27,191 --> 00:59:28,593
Speaker 1: It has a certain vibration.

1135
00:59:31,416 --> 00:59:37,984
Speaker 1: It's an unmistakable impersonal excitement

1136
00:59:39,145 --> 00:59:39,926
Speaker 1: about existence.

1137
00:59:42,672 --> 00:59:43,936
Speaker 1: It's an impersonal excitement about

1138
00:59:43,976 --> 00:59:44,378
Speaker 1: existence.

1139
00:59:44,398 --> 00:59:45,220
Speaker 1: I'm so excited.

1140
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:48,157
Speaker 1: Existence is extraordinary, profound,

1141
00:59:48,197 --> 00:59:51,177
Speaker 1: miraculous and it means we're consciously

1142
00:59:51,197 --> 00:59:54,055
Speaker 1: in touch with the miraculous nature of

1143
00:59:54,135 --> 00:59:55,420
Speaker 1: existence, inherently.

1144
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:56,936
Speaker 1: The inherently miraculous nature of

1145
00:59:57,016 --> 00:59:57,498
Speaker 1: existence.

1146
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:59,475
Speaker 1: We're consciously awake to it, we're in

1147
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:00,117
Speaker 1: touch with it, we feel it.

1148
01:00:00,137 --> 01:00:00,879
Speaker 1: It inherently miraculous nature of

1149
01:00:00,899 --> 01:00:01,080
Speaker 1: existence.

1150
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,103
Speaker 1: We're consciously awake to it, we're in

1151
01:00:02,123 --> 01:00:03,086
Speaker 1: touch with it, we feel it, it's palpable to

1152
01:00:03,106 --> 01:00:03,447
Speaker 1: us, it's palpable.

1153
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:03,768
Speaker 1: This is someone.

1154
01:00:03,788 --> 01:00:05,012
Speaker 1: When this is the case, you are someone

1155
01:00:05,032 --> 01:00:06,117
Speaker 1: who's turned on.

1156
01:00:07,351 --> 01:00:09,394
Speaker 1: You're turned on by life, I'm turned on by

1157
01:00:09,454 --> 01:00:09,675
Speaker 1: life.

1158
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:12,337
Speaker 1: And someone who's turned on by life.

1159
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:19,191
Speaker 1: If you're really turned on by life, you're

1160
01:00:19,231 --> 01:00:20,034
Speaker 1: not just trying to be, but if you really

1161
01:00:20,054 --> 01:00:20,957
Speaker 1: turned on my life, then you're gonna start

1162
01:00:20,977 --> 01:00:22,222
Speaker 1: turning other people on, because this

1163
01:00:22,804 --> 01:00:26,315
Speaker 1: excitement is infectious and it's inspiring

1164
01:00:26,355 --> 01:00:30,562
Speaker 1: and compelling, meaningful, it's righteous.

1165
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:44,335
Speaker 1: You don't want to live a boring life

1166
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:44,615
Speaker 1: anymore.

1167
01:00:44,635 --> 01:00:45,917
Speaker 1: Materialistic life and egotistically

1168
01:00:45,978 --> 01:00:48,241
Speaker 1: obsessed life no more.

1169
01:00:48,281 --> 01:00:48,662
Speaker 1: Thank you.

1170
01:00:49,864 --> 01:00:50,885
Speaker 1: I want to make a difference.

1171
01:00:50,985 --> 01:00:52,213
Speaker 1: I want the world to be a different place,

1172
01:00:52,253 --> 01:00:53,015
Speaker 1: because I was here.

1173
01:00:54,198 --> 01:00:56,102
Speaker 1: Yes, that's audacious and outrageous, but

1174
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:58,156
Speaker 1: that's how we want to begin to live.

1175
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:00,391
Speaker 1: Audaciously and outrageously, why not?

1176
01:01:00,812 --> 01:01:04,440
Speaker 1: Why live with less heroic spirit?

1177
01:01:05,382 --> 01:01:06,043
Speaker 1: Why do that?

1178
01:01:09,451 --> 01:01:11,177
Speaker 1: Too many of us are just living to survive

1179
01:01:11,538 --> 01:01:12,300
Speaker 1: this ordeal.

1180
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:16,446
Speaker 1: Why don't we make a difference in the

1181
01:01:16,467 --> 01:01:16,790
Speaker 1: meantime?

1182
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:20,780
Speaker 1: Why don't we make a difference in the

1183
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:20,961
Speaker 1: meantime?

1184
01:01:21,021 --> 01:01:26,665
Speaker 1: And if you are a, if you believe in the

1185
01:01:26,705 --> 01:01:28,914
Speaker 1: continuity of consciousness, if you believe

1186
01:01:28,934 --> 01:01:31,834
Speaker 1: in the continuity of the process, if it's

1187
01:01:31,894 --> 01:01:34,397
Speaker 1: become apparent to you that this process is

1188
01:01:34,438 --> 01:01:36,594
Speaker 1: part and parcel of a continuity, that the

1189
01:01:36,615 --> 01:01:38,284
Speaker 1: evolving universe, the evolving universe of

1190
01:01:38,325 --> 01:01:39,250
Speaker 1: a continuity with the evolving universe,

1191
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:43,590
Speaker 1: the evolving universe, is a continuity, and

1192
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:47,551
Speaker 1: that continuity exists on the outside as it

1193
01:01:47,591 --> 01:01:48,515
Speaker 1: does on the inside.

1194
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:53,951
Speaker 1: If you realize that to be true, then, even

1195
01:01:53,992 --> 01:01:55,532
Speaker 1: if only at the intellect, you begin to

1196
01:01:55,572 --> 01:01:56,115
Speaker 1: understand this.

1197
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:58,957
Speaker 1: It means you're part of something

1198
01:01:59,959 --> 01:02:02,816
Speaker 1: inconceivably vast that's on a journey of

1199
01:02:02,836 --> 01:02:06,219
Speaker 1: becoming, and this lifetime that we're in

1200
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:08,693
Speaker 1: the midst of is a snapshot, is just a

1201
01:02:08,713 --> 01:02:12,341
Speaker 1: little snapshot, of what's potentially an

1202
01:02:12,401 --> 01:02:13,343
Speaker 1: infinite unfolding.

1203
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:15,417
Speaker 1: That means we're here for the long haul,

1204
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:17,128
Speaker 1: whether your ego likes it or not.

1205
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:17,872
Speaker 1: If what I'm saying is true, that means

1206
01:02:17,825 --> 01:02:18,215
Speaker 1: we're all here for the long haul, whether

1207
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:18,411
Speaker 1: your ego likes it or not.

1208
01:02:18,364 --> 01:02:20,299
Speaker 1: If what I'm saying is true, that means

1209
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,641
Speaker 1: we're all here for the long haul.

1210
01:02:25,785 --> 01:02:29,613
Speaker 1: So, if it's true, if we're here for the

1211
01:02:29,653 --> 01:02:31,396
Speaker 1: long haul because we are part and parcel of

1212
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:37,484
Speaker 1: a process that is inconceivably vast and

1213
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:41,075
Speaker 1: potentially infinite, then it's about time

1214
01:02:41,115 --> 01:02:42,018
Speaker 1: we get behind it.

1215
01:02:43,101 --> 01:02:49,630
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm on board, baby, all the way, and

1216
01:02:49,671 --> 01:02:51,095
Speaker 1: not only for this lifetime, but for the

1217
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,900
Speaker 1: next one and the next one and the next one

1218
01:02:54,032 --> 01:02:54,816
Speaker 1: On into the future.

1219
01:02:57,772 --> 01:03:00,696
Speaker 1: What keeps us, what gets us in trouble and

1220
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:02,461
Speaker 1: keeps us in trouble, is our resistance.

1221
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:05,771
Speaker 1: It's a resistance where we're saying no, no,

1222
01:03:05,832 --> 01:03:07,117
Speaker 1: no, no, no, no, please stop.

1223
01:03:09,772 --> 01:03:11,349
Speaker 1: This rocket ship is going to move faster

1224
01:03:12,816 --> 01:03:15,455
Speaker 1: and get bigger, whether you like it or I

1225
01:03:15,515 --> 01:03:17,415
Speaker 1: like it or not, and that's because that's

1226
01:03:17,435 --> 01:03:18,491
Speaker 1: the nature of the process.

1227
01:03:20,135 --> 01:03:21,499
Speaker 1: The process is evolving.

1228
01:03:21,539 --> 01:03:24,787
Speaker 1: It's in a state of becoming bigger, more

1229
01:03:24,827 --> 01:03:25,870
Speaker 1: complex, more profound.

1230
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:26,912
Speaker 1: That's what's happening.

1231
01:03:27,914 --> 01:03:30,179
Speaker 1: So if we, if we are resisting this,

1232
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:33,493
Speaker 1: consciously or unconsciously, we won't be,

1233
01:03:33,513 --> 01:03:36,700
Speaker 1: we won't be able to know this and when we

1234
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:43,333
Speaker 1: stop resisting, we find and feel that this

1235
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:46,451
Speaker 1: forward momentum is a source of ecstasy and,

1236
01:03:46,511 --> 01:03:48,536
Speaker 1: as I was saying before, overwhelming

1237
01:03:48,576 --> 01:03:49,238
Speaker 1: positivity.

1238
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:54,335
Speaker 1: It's thrilling and it's not a thrill that's

1239
01:03:54,355 --> 01:03:55,198
Speaker 1: going to come to an end.

1240
01:03:57,772 --> 01:03:59,159
Speaker 1: This body is going to come to an end.

1241
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:02,592
Speaker 1: This body's going to come to an end, but

1242
01:04:02,613 --> 01:04:03,958
Speaker 1: not the process that you are.

1243
01:04:06,152 --> 01:04:07,638
Speaker 1: The process is happening through us.

1244
01:04:09,752 --> 01:04:13,492
Speaker 1: So when I say realize and respond, realize

1245
01:04:13,512 --> 01:04:15,098
Speaker 1: that the process is happening through you,

1246
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:17,395
Speaker 1: evolution is happening through you, and

1247
01:04:17,415 --> 01:04:22,294
Speaker 1: then respond to that and once you respond,

1248
01:04:22,314 --> 01:04:23,096
Speaker 1: keep responding.

1249
01:04:23,598 --> 01:04:27,093
Speaker 1: The more you keep responding, the process

1250
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:31,191
Speaker 1: will move faster and faster through you and

1251
01:04:31,211 --> 01:04:33,016
Speaker 1: the process will begin to realize itself,

1252
01:04:33,678 --> 01:04:36,903
Speaker 1: cognize itself and take responsibility for

1253
01:04:36,923 --> 01:04:37,648
Speaker 1: itself through your body, mind and

1254
01:04:37,668 --> 01:04:37,890
Speaker 1: personality.

1255
01:04:39,295 --> 01:04:42,987
Speaker 1: That's when you begin to understand who and

1256
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,850
Speaker 1: what God is all about.

1257
01:04:48,649 --> 01:04:56,940
Speaker 1: It's big, you can see.

1258
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,926
Speaker 1: It will be vast, profound and so inspiring.

1259
01:05:05,732 --> 01:05:09,115
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe our lives suck, but the process

1260
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,840
Speaker 1: of life itself is extraordinary, profound

1261
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,582
Speaker 1: and so beautiful.

1262
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:14,698
Speaker 1: If our lives aren't very interesting, let's

1263
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:15,220
Speaker 1: wake up.

1264
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:18,403
Speaker 1: When you wake up, you'll realize life

1265
01:05:18,443 --> 01:05:20,372
Speaker 1: itself is so profound and so interesting,

1266
01:05:20,392 --> 01:05:22,296
Speaker 1: interesting beyond measure.

1267
01:05:27,627 --> 01:05:28,730
Speaker 1: If our lives aren't that interesting, it's

1268
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,051
Speaker 1: because we have our attention on the wrong

1269
01:05:30,091 --> 01:05:30,451
Speaker 1: things.

1270
01:05:33,975 --> 01:05:42,202
Speaker 1: So so the so the main message of this talk

1271
01:05:42,383 --> 01:05:44,304
Speaker 1: that I wanted to deliver has to do with the

1272
01:05:44,345 --> 01:05:47,047
Speaker 1: simplicity of how one can do this.

1273
01:05:52,731 --> 01:05:53,112
Speaker 1: If you let.

1274
01:05:53,152 --> 01:05:54,737
Speaker 1: In the simplicity that I'm sharing with you,

1275
01:05:54,758 --> 01:05:55,580
Speaker 1: it can change your life.

1276
01:05:56,751 --> 01:05:59,778
Speaker 1: All you have to do is, from the perspective

1277
01:05:59,858 --> 01:06:05,431
Speaker 1: of being, is to realize and let go, and

1278
01:06:05,451 --> 01:06:06,916
Speaker 1: then, from the perspective of becoming, is

1279
01:06:06,936 --> 01:06:07,980
Speaker 1: to realize and respond.

1280
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:13,761
Speaker 1: And if you do it because when you, if you

1281
01:06:13,801 --> 01:06:15,044
Speaker 1: do it, everything becomes clear for you.

1282
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:18,520
Speaker 1: Because when you let go, your mind becomes

1283
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,217
Speaker 1: clear your soul is invigorated.

1284
01:06:24,111 --> 01:06:25,116
Speaker 1: You're not a victim anymore.

1285
01:06:27,951 --> 01:06:29,939
Speaker 1: You win your independence, your sovereignty,

1286
01:06:31,191 --> 01:06:35,693
Speaker 1: you become a sovereign soul, you become

1287
01:06:35,754 --> 01:06:39,116
Speaker 1: wise, all as a result of letting go.

1288
01:06:39,457 --> 01:06:40,179
Speaker 1: That's all it takes.

1289
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:43,919
Speaker 1: Just that one act can enlighten your whole

1290
01:06:43,939 --> 01:06:44,180
Speaker 1: being.

1291
01:06:46,031 --> 01:06:47,155
Speaker 1: You don't have to read a lot of books for

1292
01:06:47,175 --> 01:06:47,696
Speaker 1: that to happen.

1293
01:06:47,817 --> 01:06:53,153
Speaker 1: You don't have to read any In order to

1294
01:06:53,173 --> 01:06:55,274
Speaker 1: become a powerful player and a co-creator

1295
01:06:55,294 --> 01:06:55,897
Speaker 1: of the process.

1296
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:58,297
Speaker 1: You have to learn how to have the courage

1297
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:04,979
Speaker 1: to realize and respond and eventually learn

1298
01:07:04,999 --> 01:07:06,714
Speaker 1: how to respond in a way that moves faster

1299
01:07:06,734 --> 01:07:07,256
Speaker 1: than thought.

1300
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:13,633
Speaker 1: When we respond, when we awaken to the

1301
01:07:13,714 --> 01:07:15,694
Speaker 1: evolutionary impulse and we respond to it,

1302
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:18,176
Speaker 1: it's a response that moves faster than

1303
01:07:18,237 --> 01:07:21,079
Speaker 1: thought, faster than the mind can think.

1304
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:25,098
Speaker 1: That means you're responding from the

1305
01:07:25,158 --> 01:07:32,236
Speaker 1: source of evolutionary intelligence.

1306
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:36,558
Speaker 1: That means you'll bear witness to yourself

1307
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:36,939
Speaker 1: acting.

1308
01:07:38,251 --> 01:07:39,597
Speaker 1: You won't even know where it's coming from

1309
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:41,575
Speaker 1: it will feel so right.

1310
01:07:44,411 --> 01:07:46,177
Speaker 1: And when this happens again and again and

1311
01:07:46,217 --> 01:07:48,613
Speaker 1: again and again, you start to feel like a

1312
01:07:50,458 --> 01:07:54,119
Speaker 1: master improviser playing the game of life

1313
01:07:56,476 --> 01:08:01,241
Speaker 1: and it's contributing in ways that are very

1314
01:08:01,281 --> 01:08:01,742
Speaker 1: important.

1315
01:08:04,033 --> 01:08:05,733
Speaker 1: And in this teaching, ideally, the goal is

1316
01:08:05,773 --> 01:08:07,159
Speaker 1: to do this together with other people.

1317
01:08:07,731 --> 01:08:10,094
Speaker 1: So it's not just you by yourself, but when

1318
01:08:10,114 --> 01:08:11,512
Speaker 1: you get a group of people that are

1319
01:08:12,658 --> 01:08:17,720
Speaker 1: practicing so diligently and so much

1320
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:23,420
Speaker 1: commitment, it starts to create waves.

1321
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:40,234
Speaker 1: So in the path as a whole, I believe to

1322
01:08:40,274 --> 01:08:43,081
Speaker 1: repeat what I said earlier needs to include

1323
01:08:46,965 --> 01:08:48,472
Speaker 1: the path of sudden awakening and the path

1324
01:08:48,532 --> 01:08:49,416
Speaker 1: of gradual awakening.

1325
01:08:50,131 --> 01:08:51,134
Speaker 1: Both need to be embraced.

1326
01:08:55,163 --> 01:09:02,196
Speaker 1: Now, wake up suddenly and practice

1327
01:09:02,437 --> 01:09:03,701
Speaker 1: diligently with all of your heart.

1328
01:09:05,571 --> 01:09:08,973
Speaker 1: There's always farther to go, so much more

1329
01:09:09,013 --> 01:09:12,312
Speaker 1: to become, so much more to understand and

1330
01:09:12,332 --> 01:09:13,072
Speaker 1: so much more to create.

1331
01:09:27,991 --> 01:09:30,846
Speaker 1: The ego's reluctance is always in I don't

1332
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:31,208
Speaker 1: wanna let go.

1333
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:32,954
Speaker 1: The ego's always reluctant.

1334
01:09:32,974 --> 01:09:34,021
Speaker 1: The ego's, if you just check it out, say

1335
01:09:34,042 --> 01:09:34,626
Speaker 1: what's in the way?

1336
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:36,596
Speaker 1: The egoic reluctance to what?

1337
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:38,016
Speaker 1: To letting go and to responding.

1338
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:40,218
Speaker 1: You say but you didn't let go, why not?

1339
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:41,655
Speaker 1: You say, I don't know.

1340
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:45,396
Speaker 1: So if you pay attention, you see, the only

1341
01:09:45,436 --> 01:09:48,255
Speaker 1: thing in our way, in one's way, in your way,

1342
01:09:49,772 --> 01:09:51,396
Speaker 1: is the reluctance of the ego to either let

1343
01:09:51,456 --> 01:09:53,301
Speaker 1: go or to respond.

1344
01:09:58,931 --> 01:10:03,135
Speaker 1: It's important in life, when important

1345
01:10:03,175 --> 01:10:05,114
Speaker 1: things happen, that we respond and that

1346
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:07,040
Speaker 1: we're ready to respond without hesitation.

1347
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:09,737
Speaker 1: Preach from the egoic reluctance.

1348
01:10:11,131 --> 01:10:12,256
Speaker 1: Why didn't you respond?

1349
01:10:13,051 --> 01:10:13,494
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1350
01:10:13,574 --> 01:10:13,956
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1351
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:15,796
Speaker 1: I just always felt very reluctant.

1352
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:18,367
Speaker 1: Why I don't know?

1353
01:10:18,345 --> 01:10:18,763
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1354
01:10:18,741 --> 01:10:19,233
Speaker 1: I just always felt very reluctant.

1355
01:10:19,212 --> 01:10:22,341
Speaker 1: Why, I don't know.

1356
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:28,049
Speaker 1: But you wanted this, yeah, I know.

1357
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:32,413
Speaker 1: So if we wanna be free, letting go must be

1358
01:10:32,453 --> 01:10:36,551
Speaker 1: free from reluctance ultimately, and our

1359
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:37,551
Speaker 1: ability and willingness to respond has to

1360
01:10:37,491 --> 01:10:37,930
Speaker 1: be free from reluctance ultimately, and our

1361
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:39,452
Speaker 1: ability and willingness to respond has to

1362
01:10:39,472 --> 01:10:40,416
Speaker 1: be free from reluctance.

1363
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,174
Speaker 1: Then we're well on our way.

01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:44,656

Speaker 1: extraordinary consequences.

Speaker 1: The lives of saints and sages and great

1405

Speaker 1: realizers are expressions of exactly that.

1406
01:12:22,563 --> 01:12:27,999
Speaker 1: No, why don't we try and be like that, live

1407
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:28,459
Speaker 1: like that?

1408
01:12:29,942 --> 01:12:32,506
Speaker 1: I mean, I know life is hard.

1409
01:12:32,546 --> 01:12:36,262
Speaker 1: You know like being human is hard, but we

1410
01:12:36,282 --> 01:12:37,868
Speaker 1: have an enormous opportunity here that

1411
01:12:37,888 --> 01:12:38,310
Speaker 1: we've been given.

1412
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,630

1414

Speaker 1: Why not do everything we need to do to make

1415
01:12:46,731 --> 01:12:47,736
Speaker 1: the very best out of it?

1416
01:12:49,535 --> 01:12:50,819
Speaker 1: I can't imagine there could be anything

1417
01:12:50,839 --> 01:12:51,581
Speaker 1: more important to do.

1418
01:12:53,152 --> 01:12:54,974
Speaker 1: Why would anything less than that be make

1419
01:12:55,014 --> 01:12:55,555
Speaker 1: any sense?

1420
01:13:02,923 --> 01:13:04,285
Speaker 1: So everything that I'm to repeat,

1421
01:13:04,305 --> 01:13:09,800
Speaker 1: everything that I'm sharing with you, you

1422
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:15,567
Speaker 1: can do immediately, you can realize and let

1423
01:13:15,587 --> 01:13:20,386
Speaker 1: go tomorrow, and you can realize and

1424
01:13:20,406 --> 01:13:20,567
Speaker 1: respond.

1425
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:23,395
Speaker 1: I'm saying tomorrow because where I am it's

1426
01:13:23,415 --> 01:13:24,699
Speaker 1: evening time, but if it's the early morning

1427
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,233
Speaker 1: where you are, or the middle of the day,

1428
01:13:27,857 --> 01:13:28,358
Speaker 1: even better.

1429
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:31,232
Speaker 1: No need to wait till tomorrow morning.

1430
01:13:40,644 --> 01:13:43,771
Speaker 1: So I think we should be grateful, we should

1431
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:44,674
Speaker 1: learn to be grateful for the infinite

1432
01:13:44,695 --> 01:13:44,956
Speaker 1: opportunity.

1433
01:13:44,996 --> 01:13:49,095
Speaker 1: We have to do this Because as long as we're

1434
01:13:49,115 --> 01:13:50,794
Speaker 1: breathing, as long as breath is going in

1435
01:13:50,834 --> 01:13:53,834
Speaker 1: and out of our lungs, we're not in too much

1436
01:13:53,895 --> 01:13:54,176
Speaker 1: pain.

1437
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:59,481
Speaker 1: We can realize and let go in every moment.

1438
01:14:02,311 --> 01:14:03,515
Speaker 1: And in the same way, as long as we're

1439
01:14:03,535 --> 01:14:04,650
Speaker 1: breathing in and not in too much pain, we

1440
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:06,076
Speaker 1: can realize and respond with all of our

1441
01:14:06,116 --> 01:14:06,397
