1
00:00:01,062 --> 00:00:03,286
Speaker 1: So we're going to speak about a very

2
00:00:03,506 --> 00:00:07,313
Speaker 1: difficult and challenging subject today or

3
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:09,501
Speaker 1: tonight, wherever you are the subject of

4
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:10,262
Speaker 1: non-duality.

5
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:15,929
Speaker 1: This is a very mysterious and often

6
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:21,096
Speaker 1: ambiguous word or statement or definition

7
00:00:21,156 --> 00:00:21,796
Speaker 1: of reality.

8
00:00:23,742 --> 00:00:26,389
Speaker 1: So for all seekers of enlightenment, this

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,342
Speaker 1: whole notion of non-duality is very popular.

10
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:33,432
Speaker 1: Non-duality means oneness, and I want to

11
00:00:33,452 --> 00:00:35,781
Speaker 1: try and talk about my understanding of what

12
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:38,745
Speaker 1: that actually means, not only as a

13
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:43,691
Speaker 1: metaphysical and esoteric truth or

14
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:47,596
Speaker 1: fundamental reality, but also how, even

15
00:00:47,636 --> 00:00:52,464
Speaker 1: more importantly, I want to talk about how

16
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:55,458
Speaker 1: we can best relate to non-duality if we

17
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:57,652
Speaker 1: want to, if we're seeking to awaken to

18
00:00:57,692 --> 00:01:00,266
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness, if we want to not

19
00:01:00,306 --> 00:01:01,720
Speaker 1: only understand it intellectually but

20
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,526
Speaker 1: actually experience the truth of what it

21
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:05,151
Speaker 1: actually means, which is the whole point.

22
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:08,566
Speaker 1: There's a very challenging, serious

23
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:11,625
Speaker 1: question of how do we relate to this whole

24
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:13,229
Speaker 1: question of what the ultimate truth is

25
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:13,811
Speaker 1: supposed to be.

26
00:01:16,023 --> 00:01:18,424
Speaker 1: Not an easy, it's not easy, and that's what

27
00:01:18,464 --> 00:01:20,029
Speaker 1: I want to try and spend some time working

28
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:21,396
Speaker 1: on that with everybody, but starting at the

29
00:01:21,068 --> 00:01:21,489
Speaker 1: beginning.

30
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:27,978
Speaker 1: I met with everybody, but starting at the

31
00:01:27,998 --> 00:01:28,219
Speaker 1: beginning.

32
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,663
Speaker 1: I hear a lot of people speak about

33
00:01:29,683 --> 00:01:34,582
Speaker 1: non-duality as meaning oneness, but I'm

34
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:36,268
Speaker 1: never quite sure what it actually means

35
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:37,763
Speaker 1: when people see, because often when people

36
00:01:37,803 --> 00:01:41,545
Speaker 1: speak about oneness it's said rather

37
00:01:41,585 --> 00:01:44,007
Speaker 1: casually as oh yeah, everything is one.

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,340
Speaker 1: And.

39
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,224
Speaker 1: And it's said rather casually as oh yeah,

40
00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:48,767
Speaker 1: everything is one.

41
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:50,470
Speaker 1: And I wonder, when we speak casually about

42
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,692
Speaker 1: something like this, if we actually know

43
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:52,514
Speaker 1: what we're talking about.

44
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,182
Speaker 1: More often than not, it's kind of a

45
00:01:55,222 --> 00:01:59,928
Speaker 1: throwaway concept.

46
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:02,632
Speaker 1: Non-duality, as I've understood it and as I

47
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:10,612
Speaker 1: as my guru revealed to me, is ultimately

48
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:14,100
Speaker 1: it's a great mystery.

49
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:16,377
Speaker 1: And non-duality is something that we can

50
00:02:16,398 --> 00:02:18,097
Speaker 1: experience, but it's something that's very

51
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:19,425
Speaker 1: difficult to understand with the mind.

52
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:25,021
Speaker 1: So this is a very dualistic challenge in a

53
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,389
Speaker 1: way, if non-duality or the ultimate truth

54
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:29,906
Speaker 1: of oneness, the oneness of all things,

55
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,845
Speaker 1: something we can experience deeply.

56
00:02:38,149 --> 00:02:39,251
Speaker 1: Because it said, of course, that the

57
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:41,295
Speaker 1: experience of non-duality or oneness, the

58
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,208
Speaker 1: ultimate truth, can radically liberate us

59
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:45,721
Speaker 1: at the level of the heart and level of the

60
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:46,062
Speaker 1: soul.

61
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,669
Speaker 1: So that means everything for the true

62
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:50,070
Speaker 1: seeker.

63
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,882
Speaker 1: What experience is that that I, what

64
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,726
Speaker 1: experience is that that I can find that can

65
00:02:55,548 --> 00:02:57,193
Speaker 1: liberate me radically, absolutely,

66
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,726
Speaker 1: completely, permanently, totally, once and

67
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:00,467
Speaker 1: for all and forever?

68
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:03,053
Speaker 1: It means a lot.

69
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:07,387
Speaker 1: So the fact that this mystery exists and

70
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:08,683
Speaker 1: that it can be experienced, but not

71
00:03:08,744 --> 00:03:11,763
Speaker 1: understood with the mind, is why it makes

72
00:03:11,823 --> 00:03:12,625
Speaker 1: it so challenging.

73
00:03:17,394 --> 00:03:20,085
Speaker 1: So I want to try and talk about what this

74
00:03:20,145 --> 00:03:25,285
Speaker 1: actually means If we speak, because when

75
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,405
Speaker 1: I'm referring to non-duality or the

76
00:03:27,445 --> 00:03:29,085
Speaker 1: ultimate truth, I'm speaking about the

77
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:34,220
Speaker 1: ultimate answer that sets us free, the

78
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:37,025
Speaker 1: ultimate answer to all spiritual questions,

79
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:38,971
Speaker 1: metaphysical questions, religious questions

80
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:41,607
Speaker 1: what's the ultimate answer that will really

81
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:43,246
Speaker 1: liberate us and level up our souls?

82
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,784
Speaker 1: So in the great religious traditions would

83
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,902
Speaker 1: be the word oneness To mean oneness.

84
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:57,042
Speaker 1: Often we speak of God, we speak of an

85
00:03:57,122 --> 00:04:05,416
Speaker 1: anthropomorphic expression of oneness as a

86
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:11,896
Speaker 1: cosmic being, as a cosmic being with whom

87
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:16,000
Speaker 1: we can have a relationship with, and it is

88
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,801
Speaker 1: said by true believers that this cosmic

89
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:17,662
Speaker 1: being is the primary and fundamental

90
00:04:17,722 --> 00:04:23,428
Speaker 1: creative force, not in the universe but as

91
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:28,534
Speaker 1: the universe, that this cosmic being is

92
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:34,440
Speaker 1: everything and also created everything, is

93
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,903
Speaker 1: everything and is always, always creating

94
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:36,224
Speaker 1: everything also.

95
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:40,632
Speaker 1: So when you can think of oneness more as a

96
00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:45,107
Speaker 1: cosmic being than as a mysterious, formless,

97
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:50,945
Speaker 1: shapeless nothingness, it's much easier for

98
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:59,105
Speaker 1: the mind and we can think about these

99
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:02,552
Speaker 1: concepts or these higher truths in many

100
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:03,074
Speaker 1: different ways.

101
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,240
Speaker 1: Whatever will be helpful to us, higher

102
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:05,104
Speaker 1: truths in many different ways, whatever

103
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:04,495
Speaker 1: will be helpful to us.

104
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:12,196
Speaker 1: But this evening, or where I am this

105
00:05:12,257 --> 00:05:16,274
Speaker 1: evening, I want to try and focus not on God

106
00:05:16,314 --> 00:05:18,045
Speaker 1: as the principle, as the cosmic being, but

107
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:25,329
Speaker 1: as the ultimate nature of reality, the

108
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:26,532
Speaker 1: ultimate nature of reality.

109
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:33,962
Speaker 1: The ultimate nature of reality, the

110
00:05:33,982 --> 00:05:35,846
Speaker 1: ultimate nature of reality, as I understand,

111
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:38,712
Speaker 1: would have to include everything that

112
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:43,149
Speaker 1: exists and simultaneously transcend

113
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:44,733
Speaker 1: everything that exists at the same time.

114
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:47,927
Speaker 1: So, if we want to begin to think about this

115
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:52,627
Speaker 1: a little bit, what is it that does or could

116
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:57,282
Speaker 1: include everything that exists, absolutely

117
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:58,748
Speaker 1: everything, seen and unseen, known and

118
00:05:58,828 --> 00:06:04,081
Speaker 1: unknown, manifest and unmanifest, and

119
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:06,348
Speaker 1: simultaneously transcend it all at the same

120
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:06,689
Speaker 1: time?

121
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:11,049
Speaker 1: This is kind of a transrational cognition.

122
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,406
Speaker 1: It's a transrational knowing.

123
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:16,106
Speaker 1: It's a knowing of a great mystery that

124
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,183
Speaker 1: reveals itself to us when the mind begins

125
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:19,486
Speaker 1: to quiet down and recede into the

126
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:19,987
Speaker 1: background.

127
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:24,217
Speaker 1: So the awakening to enlightened awareness

128
00:06:24,237 --> 00:06:25,120
Speaker 1: or the experience of enlightened awareness,

129
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,320
Speaker 1: so the awakening to enlightened awareness

130
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,947
Speaker 1: or the experience of enlightened awareness

131
00:06:31,686 --> 00:06:37,448
Speaker 1: emerges in our consciousness when our

132
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:42,031
Speaker 1: rational faculties calm down and quiet down,

133
00:06:42,622 --> 00:06:43,948
Speaker 1: especially if we're yearning for it.

134
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:46,508
Speaker 1: We really want to know what the truth,

135
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:47,612
Speaker 1: especially if we're yearning for it.

136
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:49,880
Speaker 1: We really want to know what the truth is,

137
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,789
Speaker 1: if we're yearning for the God principle or

138
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:53,814
Speaker 1: this absolute principle to reveal itself to

139
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:58,680
Speaker 1: us, if we're yearning for revelation, if

140
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,086
Speaker 1: we're yearning for intimacy with the

141
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,913
Speaker 1: absolute, which is an important part of

142
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:07,389
Speaker 1: being a truth seeker, is the metaphysical

143
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:09,682
Speaker 1: yearning metaphysical burning, metaphysical

144
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:14,121
Speaker 1: torment to be one with one's maker, to be

145
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:17,802
Speaker 1: one with the absolute truth, the yearning

146
00:07:17,822 --> 00:07:21,292
Speaker 1: to find a way to be at home in the universe.

147
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:25,406
Speaker 1: And ultimately, the only way to be truly at

148
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:30,118
Speaker 1: home here is to discover what the ultimate

149
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,747
Speaker 1: principle behind the created and the

150
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:38,293
Speaker 1: uncreated is and to merge with it, or to

151
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:39,300
Speaker 1: realize and experience.

152
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:40,920
Speaker 1: And it's fundamentally about relationship

153
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:45,132
Speaker 1: on so many levels at the same time.

154
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,889
Speaker 1: It's about so much of our conscious

155
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:50,924
Speaker 1: experience of being human exists in a

156
00:07:50,944 --> 00:07:53,522
Speaker 1: dualistic context and framework, multiple

157
00:07:53,562 --> 00:07:56,521
Speaker 1: dimensions at the same time, and so many

158
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:59,590
Speaker 1: relationships happening within us.

159
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,844
Speaker 1: But it seems that when it comes to the

160
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:12,062
Speaker 1: ultimate question, but it seems that when

161
00:08:12,082 --> 00:08:12,946
Speaker 1: it comes to the ultimate question of

162
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:13,770
Speaker 1: ultimacy, that there is a truth, that the

163
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,634
Speaker 1: truth that liberates us is beyond the

164
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:16,101
Speaker 1: notion of any duality or relationship at

165
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:16,361
Speaker 1: all.

166
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,799
Speaker 1: And why this is so magnificent and deeply

167
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:27,343
Speaker 1: challenging is because it seems that,

168
00:08:28,747 --> 00:08:30,621
Speaker 1: ultimately, if we want to be free, if we

169
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:31,866
Speaker 1: want to know the truth, if we want to be

170
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:34,223
Speaker 1: one with our maker, one with this absolute

171
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:37,524
Speaker 1: principle, we ultimately have to let go of

172
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:39,610
Speaker 1: the notion of any relationship with him or

173
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:41,407
Speaker 1: her at any level.

174
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:45,227
Speaker 1: So it would seem that letting go of the

175
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:51,248
Speaker 1: need to have that relationship at the

176
00:08:51,288 --> 00:08:54,607
Speaker 1: deepest level of our being would make us

177
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:57,707
Speaker 1: available to know who or what he or she

178
00:08:57,808 --> 00:08:58,370
Speaker 1: actually is.

179
00:09:00,982 --> 00:09:06,611
Speaker 1: And it seems that the most sophisticated at

180
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:08,401
Speaker 1: least in my understanding, seems that the

181
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:11,491
Speaker 1: most sophisticated level of realization,

182
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:14,547
Speaker 1: realization of enlightened awareness, is

183
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:21,125
Speaker 1: the understanding of how to sustain a level

184
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:23,667
Speaker 1: of intimacy, of cosmic intimacy, with the

185
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:27,170
Speaker 1: absolute principle which requires us to

186
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,394
Speaker 1: simultaneously let go of it, let go of him

187
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:33,956
Speaker 1: or her unconditionally, radically,

188
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:38,460
Speaker 1: absolutely, totally, completely, without

189
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,486
Speaker 1: reservation, hesitation, once and for all

190
00:09:40,506 --> 00:09:41,689
Speaker 1: and forever, so that we can find and

191
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:44,402
Speaker 1: experience that intimacy, the deepest level

192
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:44,724
Speaker 1: of our being.

193
00:09:44,744 --> 00:09:47,558
Speaker 1: And the reason why this is so spiritually

194
00:09:47,598 --> 00:09:49,305
Speaker 1: challenging and metaphysically challenging

195
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:55,053
Speaker 1: is it requires a level of superhuman trust.

196
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:59,568
Speaker 1: We have to be able to, we have to find a

197
00:09:59,588 --> 00:10:03,216
Speaker 1: way to be able to trust in the ultimate

198
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:06,727
Speaker 1: mystery that transcends life and death more

199
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:09,293
Speaker 1: than we trust in the ultimate mystery that

200
00:10:09,313 --> 00:10:10,517
Speaker 1: transcends life and death more than we

201
00:10:10,557 --> 00:10:13,504
Speaker 1: trust in anything else, even though that

202
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:14,328
Speaker 1: mystery is something that we can't touch

203
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:14,689
Speaker 1: and we can't see.

204
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,016
Speaker 1: It's a mystery we'll never be able to touch,

205
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:21,326
Speaker 1: we'll never be able to see, we'll never be

206
00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:22,509
Speaker 1: able to hold On the level of the human

207
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:24,252
Speaker 1: personality and the ego.

208
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:27,185
Speaker 1: Transcendence is very much about this

209
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:28,790
Speaker 1: ultimate challenge of being able to trust

210
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:35,030
Speaker 1: in that which we cannot see unwaveringly

211
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:42,807
Speaker 1: and doubtlessly, passionately and eternally,

212
00:10:45,308 --> 00:10:46,391
Speaker 1: seems to be the great trick.

213
00:10:50,222 --> 00:10:52,842
Speaker 1: So my guru said to me once and I often

214
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:57,014
Speaker 1: repeat this teaching that the only

215
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:58,121
Speaker 1: difference between enlightenment and

216
00:10:58,141 --> 00:10:59,085
Speaker 1: unenlightenment is doubt.

217
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:05,249
Speaker 1: And I was thinking really, the only

218
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,300
Speaker 1: difference between enlightenment and

219
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:07,264
Speaker 1: unenlightenment is doubt.

220
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:12,102
Speaker 1: I always thought prior to that, at least

221
00:11:12,142 --> 00:11:15,206
Speaker 1: prior to him saying that, which was over 35

222
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:18,723
Speaker 1: years ago at this point, prior to hearing

223
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,148
Speaker 1: him make that statement, I always thought

224
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:22,404
Speaker 1: that the that enlightenment was an

225
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:26,366
Speaker 1: experience, a kind of the presence of a

226
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:28,081
Speaker 1: certain kind of metaphysical feeling or

227
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:28,762
Speaker 1: vibration.

228
00:11:31,085 --> 00:11:39,137
Speaker 1: Or, yeah, I always thought enlightenment

229
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,704
Speaker 1: was an experience of some kind, a subtle

230
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:43,317
Speaker 1: experience, a profound, subtle experience

231
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:49,031
Speaker 1: of some kind, of some kind a subtle

232
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:50,494
Speaker 1: experience, a profound, subtle experience

233
00:11:50,554 --> 00:11:50,834
Speaker 1: of some kind.

234
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:52,117
Speaker 1: And now he was telling me that

235
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:54,161
Speaker 1: enlightenment is not an experience, it's a

236
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,124
Speaker 1: relationship to the totality of reality in

237
00:11:55,144 --> 00:11:56,489
Speaker 1: all its complexity, that is free from doubt.

238
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:01,749
Speaker 1: So what is the nature of a relationship

239
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:03,338
Speaker 1: with the totality of reality that is free

240
00:12:03,378 --> 00:12:03,740
Speaker 1: from doubt?

241
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,662
Speaker 1: So what is the nature of a relationship

242
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,563
Speaker 1: with the totality of reality that's free

243
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:06,706
Speaker 1: from doubt?

244
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:10,132
Speaker 1: So I think it works something like this

245
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,222
Speaker 1: when you wake up, when we wake up, when we

246
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:21,425
Speaker 1: wake up in our moments of deepest insight

247
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:23,349
Speaker 1: and knowing and recognition about the

248
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,514
Speaker 1: ultimate truth, about the nature of reality,

249
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:28,526
Speaker 1: in those moments we realize that

250
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:30,411
Speaker 1: everything's okay.

251
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:33,505
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean everything's working out

252
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,170
Speaker 1: how our ego would like things to work out,

253
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,025
Speaker 1: but it means, at a much higher and deeper

254
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:40,161
Speaker 1: level, at a transcendental level, we can

255
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:41,205
Speaker 1: feel and experience the all-rightness of

256
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:42,109
Speaker 1: all things in a way that deeply liberates

257
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:42,671
Speaker 1: us from fear and attachment.

258
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:43,514
Speaker 1: We can feel and experience the all

259
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,961
Speaker 1: rightness of all things in a way that

260
00:12:46,062 --> 00:12:48,108
Speaker 1: ultimately deeply liberates us from fear

261
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,830
Speaker 1: and attachment, which is what freedom is

262
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,271
Speaker 1: all about.

263
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,183
Speaker 1: So there is a connection between being

264
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:09,246
Speaker 1: doubtless about that friend that you'll

265
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:12,268
Speaker 1: never be able to see and the steep

266
00:13:12,468 --> 00:13:15,170
Speaker 1: metaphysical, emotional, psychological, but

267
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,012
Speaker 1: more metaphysical relinquishment of

268
00:13:18,052 --> 00:13:24,577
Speaker 1: attachment, and relinquishing our

269
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:30,924
Speaker 1: attachment to our fear, to our self concern

270
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:34,858
Speaker 1: and to our existential anxiety about

271
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:35,199
Speaker 1: existence itself.

272
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,530
Speaker 1: There's something inexplicably profound

273
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:47,483
Speaker 1: about being so sure that, at the highest

274
00:13:47,503 --> 00:13:48,005
Speaker 1: level, everything's okay.

275
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:50,305
Speaker 1: It allows us to be, to experience freedom

276
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:53,480
Speaker 1: in the midst of chaos and insecurity.

277
00:13:56,068 --> 00:14:00,128
Speaker 1: This is very important because, ultimately,

278
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:03,747
Speaker 1: liberation is also about the soul, and is

279
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:04,784
Speaker 1: our soul going to be liberated?

280
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:05,632
Speaker 1: Are we going to experience liberation at

281
00:14:05,652 --> 00:14:05,833
Speaker 1: the level.

282
00:14:05,854 --> 00:14:06,580
Speaker 1: Is our soul going to be liberated?

283
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,120
Speaker 1: Are we going to experience liberation at

284
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,502
Speaker 1: the level of our own soul when we die, or

285
00:14:11,944 --> 00:14:12,447
Speaker 1: are we going to go?

286
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,408
Speaker 1: Oh my God, what a mess I've made.

287
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:16,686
Speaker 1: So much is unresolved.

288
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:19,767
Speaker 1: I've got to go back and do it again.

289
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:33,976
Speaker 1: This is very much about ultimacy and what

290
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:35,523
Speaker 1: the consciousness and cognizance of

291
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:37,289
Speaker 1: ultimacy has to do with our relationship to

292
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:41,208
Speaker 1: life in the biggest sense of what that

293
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:48,678
Speaker 1: actually means, in the biggest sense of

294
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:49,440
Speaker 1: what that actually means.

295
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,423
Speaker 1: So, at the level of the soul, are we always

296
00:14:51,463 --> 00:14:56,901
Speaker 1: already convinced that it's okay or are we

297
00:14:56,941 --> 00:15:01,660
Speaker 1: living in fear, confusion, anxiety and

298
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,046
Speaker 1: frustration and terror?

299
00:15:12,857 --> 00:15:13,719
Speaker 1: So are we?

300
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:15,321
Speaker 1: Have we found that friend?

301
00:15:16,443 --> 00:15:17,885
Speaker 1: I'll never be able to sleep because when

302
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:20,896
Speaker 1: you do find that friend, when the friend

303
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:24,243
Speaker 1: does appear, and sometimes for the truth

304
00:15:24,283 --> 00:15:27,114
Speaker 1: seeker, most truth seekers have

305
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:30,580
Speaker 1: breakthrough experiences which permanently

306
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:33,325
Speaker 1: transform their relationship to life.

307
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,779
Speaker 1: Breakthrough experiences actually change us.

308
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:41,156
Speaker 1: A lot of people have many breakthrough,

309
00:15:41,337 --> 00:15:43,300
Speaker 1: many breakthrough experiences that make a

310
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,791
Speaker 1: deep metaphysical impression to the level

311
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:47,356
Speaker 1: of the soul, but they don't change us

312
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:48,039
Speaker 1: necessarily.

313
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:51,170
Speaker 1: And the deep into deep breakthrough

314
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,977
Speaker 1: experiences actually change us in a

315
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:54,840
Speaker 1: fundamental way.

316
00:15:57,216 --> 00:15:58,280
Speaker 1: The experience is deep enough.

317
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:00,268
Speaker 1: It means that once this breakthrough has

318
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:00,630
Speaker 1: occurred.

319
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,659
Speaker 1: We're not the same person anymore because

320
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:06,836
Speaker 1: we've seen something and the seeing of

321
00:16:06,896 --> 00:16:09,390
Speaker 1: which has permanently altered our soul's

322
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:11,515
Speaker 1: relationship to the existence of this body,

323
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:15,288
Speaker 1: ultimately altered our soul's relationship

324
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:15,950
Speaker 1: to the existence of this body.

325
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,496
Speaker 1: Because once you deeply know, once you

326
00:16:22,536 --> 00:16:25,554
Speaker 1: deeply know and you know that you know

327
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,395
Speaker 1: you're not the same person anymore.

328
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:35,686
Speaker 1: And do we have the courage, once we've seen

329
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:37,013
Speaker 1: so deeply into the ultimate nature of

330
00:16:37,074 --> 00:16:40,271
Speaker 1: reality, never to doubt the non-relative or

331
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:43,998
Speaker 1: ultimate truth about what we've seen, will

332
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:51,677
Speaker 1: we become scared and fearful and recoil in

333
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:57,688
Speaker 1: fear and doubt, because not to doubt and

334
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:05,965
Speaker 1: recoil in fear and doubt, because not to

335
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:07,030
Speaker 1: doubt requires enormous courage and faith,

336
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:09,518
Speaker 1: faith in the ultimate truth that we can't

337
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:10,662
Speaker 1: see.

338
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,093
Speaker 1: So, while the awakening to non-duality,

339
00:17:16,113 --> 00:17:17,478
Speaker 1: which is the ultimate truth that transcends

340
00:17:17,518 --> 00:17:20,337
Speaker 1: life and death, is an actual metaphysical

341
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:24,250
Speaker 1: experience, it's attainable and realizable.

342
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:28,394
Speaker 1: Being able to sustain that spiritual

343
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,779
Speaker 1: self-confidence that comes from such an

344
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:35,501
Speaker 1: event requires a very high degree of faith,

345
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,531
Speaker 1: and faith means being doubtless about that

346
00:17:41,572 --> 00:17:44,912
Speaker 1: which we can't prove, that which we can't

347
00:17:44,992 --> 00:17:49,463
Speaker 1: touch or taste or see with our eyes.

348
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,338
Speaker 1: So being doubtless about what we can't see

349
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:01,714
Speaker 1: is the key to spiritual self-confidence as

350
00:18:01,754 --> 00:18:03,159
Speaker 1: the result of awakening to enlightened

351
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:03,680
Speaker 1: awareness.

352
00:18:08,112 --> 00:18:09,617
Speaker 1: It took me a long time to understand what

353
00:18:09,637 --> 00:18:12,014
Speaker 1: the Master meant about the difference

354
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:13,398
Speaker 1: between enlightenment and unenlightenment

355
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:13,860
Speaker 1: is doubt.

356
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,112
Speaker 1: I said, really that's it.

357
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,675
Speaker 1: Get back to what I was speaking about a few

358
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:21,136
Speaker 1: minutes ago.

359
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,716
Speaker 1: It's not about the presence or lack of

360
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:26,036
Speaker 1: presence of a particular feeling, a

361
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:27,059
Speaker 1: particular vibration.

362
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:34,774
Speaker 1: No, once you know, and you know that you

363
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:38,742
Speaker 1: have known because if you have, if you have

364
00:18:38,822 --> 00:18:40,933
Speaker 1: known, if you have experienced revelation

365
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:45,903
Speaker 1: of the highest order and you realize this

366
00:18:46,123 --> 00:18:52,016
Speaker 1: is it, this is the truth, I realize what

367
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:53,458
Speaker 1: I'm saying is very audacious, but I can't

368
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:57,282
Speaker 1: help it, I've got to say it when you

369
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,785
Speaker 1: realize you've seen it, you've experienced

370
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:06,810
Speaker 1: it, you've tasted it and it's touched you,

371
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,257
Speaker 1: is that experience enough to convince you

372
00:19:09,277 --> 00:19:11,433
Speaker 1: at a soul level that you've seen it, or

373
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:16,086
Speaker 1: will you recoil in doubt and terror and

374
00:19:16,126 --> 00:19:21,504
Speaker 1: confusion and self-obsession and need to

375
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:23,194
Speaker 1: have another experience to prove it to you

376
00:19:23,234 --> 00:19:23,535
Speaker 1: again?

377
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:29,297
Speaker 1: And then, when it happens a second time,

378
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:31,358
Speaker 1: will that be enough for you to believe it

379
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,133
Speaker 1: or will you need to be convinced by another

380
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:35,157
Speaker 1: experience yet again?

381
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:42,697
Speaker 1: Because if enlightenment means anything at

382
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:45,317
Speaker 1: all, it means that we already know, that we

383
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:48,491
Speaker 1: know, and the confidence in that knowing is

384
00:19:48,531 --> 00:19:51,317
Speaker 1: not dependent upon any particular kind of

385
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,635
Speaker 1: the presence of any particular kind of

386
00:19:52,676 --> 00:20:00,372
Speaker 1: feeling, any particular kind of vibration,

387
00:20:00,392 --> 00:20:01,233
Speaker 1: presence of any particular kind of feeling,

388
00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:01,955
Speaker 1: any particular kind of vibration or

389
00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:02,837
Speaker 1: experience, even though, uh, paradoxically,

390
00:20:02,977 --> 00:20:05,903
Speaker 1: of course, people in whom people, in whom

391
00:20:05,963 --> 00:20:08,589
Speaker 1: people who have been deeply touched by this

392
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:11,015
Speaker 1: mystery, touching the way that is, that is

393
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:13,220
Speaker 1: rare and profound and deep and

394
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:18,115
Speaker 1: transformational usually become portals

395
00:20:18,155 --> 00:20:19,399
Speaker 1: themselves to this mystery.

396
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,195
Speaker 1: The body, mind and the personality of such

397
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:26,962
Speaker 1: individuals become portals.

398
00:20:27,082 --> 00:20:37,094
Speaker 1: They become because they have access.

399
00:20:37,114 --> 00:20:38,566
Speaker 1: Now this mystery has penetrated their soul

400
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:40,876
Speaker 1: so deeply, but now the mystery itself

401
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:43,556
Speaker 1: speaks through them, because the mystery

402
00:20:43,597 --> 00:20:47,847
Speaker 1: has its own voice and this ultimate mystery

403
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:51,759
Speaker 1: that's enlightenment is seeking for a way

404
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,235
Speaker 1: to be heard, to be seen, to be recognized

405
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:55,118
Speaker 1: by more and more of us.

406
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:57,153
Speaker 1: As I've often said, consciousness delights

407
00:20:57,193 --> 00:21:00,492
Speaker 1: in its own self-recognition, consciousness

408
00:21:00,532 --> 00:21:02,339
Speaker 1: delights in its own self-recognition.

409
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,571
Speaker 1: So consciousness is seeking for its own

410
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:05,816
Speaker 1: self-recognition through us.

411
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,990
Speaker 1: And when consciousness bursts through a

412
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:19,692
Speaker 1: worthy and sincere soul, the realization is,

413
00:21:19,793 --> 00:21:22,120
Speaker 1: even if that hole remains an open portal,

414
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:27,620
Speaker 1: the spirit itself and, paradoxically,

415
00:21:28,402 --> 00:21:35,118
Speaker 1: spiritual vibrations and miracle and

416
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:38,154
Speaker 1: mystery of transmission of this kind of

417
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:41,355
Speaker 1: knowledge begins to pour forth through such

418
00:21:41,395 --> 00:21:42,058
Speaker 1: individuals.

419
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:45,977
Speaker 1: And this will only happen when one is

420
00:21:46,017 --> 00:21:46,459
Speaker 1: doubtless.

421
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:51,126
Speaker 1: It's not dependent upon having a particular

422
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:52,554
Speaker 1: experience, having a particular kind of

423
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:54,835
Speaker 1: feeling pressing in a particular kind of

424
00:21:54,895 --> 00:21:55,277
Speaker 1: knowing.

425
00:21:57,412 --> 00:22:02,994
Speaker 1: It just means having no doubt, and having

426
00:22:03,034 --> 00:22:04,117
Speaker 1: no doubt means, no matter what your

427
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,481
Speaker 1: experience is, you have no doubt.

428
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:08,397
Speaker 1: You have no doubt if you're feeling good,

429
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,555
Speaker 1: you have no doubt if you're feeling

430
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:09,957
Speaker 1: miserable.

431
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,280
Speaker 1: It means your doubtlessness is not

432
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,016
Speaker 1: dependent upon your emotional states or the

433
00:22:18,056 --> 00:22:19,701
Speaker 1: relative circumstances of your personal

434
00:22:19,761 --> 00:22:19,981
Speaker 1: life.

435
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:24,050
Speaker 1: It's a doubtlessness that transcends

436
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,252
Speaker 1: duality and all relative circumstances.

437
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:48,814
Speaker 1: So so I wanted what I wanted to ask a lot

438
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:54,578
Speaker 1: of you to try and do, would be to to

439
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:58,590
Speaker 1: consider for yourselves what would it be

440
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:04,055
Speaker 1: like to have no doubt in an ultimate truth,

441
00:23:04,115 --> 00:23:05,276
Speaker 1: in an ultimate ministry that you'll never?

442
00:23:05,396 --> 00:23:14,083
Speaker 1: And how comfortable are you, or is your ego

443
00:23:17,285 --> 00:23:19,788
Speaker 1: with not needing proof all the time?

444
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:27,735
Speaker 1: At which point in your own spiritual

445
00:23:27,795 --> 00:23:30,201
Speaker 1: evolution, will knowing that you know be

446
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:30,482
Speaker 1: enough?

447
00:23:33,222 --> 00:23:34,066
Speaker 1: Will knowing that you know be enough?

448
00:23:34,515 --> 00:23:35,710
Speaker 1: And you don't need the God principle.

449
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:37,756
Speaker 1: She doesn't need to prove herself to you

450
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:43,985
Speaker 1: yet again, because now, because she already

451
00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:46,518
Speaker 1: has revealed herself to you and you know

452
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,337
Speaker 1: she has you have no doubt that she has

453
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:56,239
Speaker 1: revealed herself to you completely and you

454
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,701
Speaker 1: don't need to be convinced again because

455
00:23:57,721 --> 00:24:00,844
Speaker 1: you're already convinced Now.

456
00:24:00,884 --> 00:24:02,186
Speaker 1: If you have that kind of spiritual

457
00:24:02,206 --> 00:24:05,448
Speaker 1: self-confidence, you're going to become a

458
00:24:05,468 --> 00:24:08,394
Speaker 1: powerful person, because you don't need God

459
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:09,916
Speaker 1: to prove herself to you yet again.

460
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:16,845
Speaker 1: To repeat what I was saying earlier, too

461
00:24:16,885 --> 00:24:22,022
Speaker 1: many of us need it to be proved to us again

462
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:30,378
Speaker 1: and I think the ultimate truth about the

463
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:31,762
Speaker 1: nature of reality, which is the God

464
00:24:31,802 --> 00:24:35,600
Speaker 1: principle, needs, in this miserable world

465
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:39,068
Speaker 1: for more and more of us to be able to bear

466
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:44,178
Speaker 1: witness to her presence, to her radiant

467
00:24:44,218 --> 00:24:48,555
Speaker 1: presence, to her existence, to her own

468
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:52,736
Speaker 1: doubtlessness in the face of fear and

469
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:55,382
Speaker 1: multiple dimensions of duality, chaos and

470
00:24:55,422 --> 00:24:55,883
Speaker 1: conflict.

471
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,656
Speaker 1: You know, at the beginning of the path,

472
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,895
Speaker 1: we're in this for our own benefit, for our

473
00:25:05,915 --> 00:25:08,572
Speaker 1: own liberation, which is understandable.

474
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:20,712
Speaker 1: But at a certain point we begin to realize

475
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:22,056
Speaker 1: that the God force, this esoteric or

476
00:25:22,096 --> 00:25:24,302
Speaker 1: metaphysical principle in the cosmos, very

477
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:27,211
Speaker 1: much needs us to bear witness to her

478
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:30,660
Speaker 1: presence, not for our own sake, but for

479
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,754
Speaker 1: everybody else's sake, because the God

480
00:25:34,774 --> 00:25:36,159
Speaker 1: principle doesn't exist up there.

481
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:40,358
Speaker 1: The God principle doesn't exist up there.

482
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:44,581
Speaker 1: She exists here and here and everywhere.

483
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:52,452
Speaker 1: And it's up to us as realizers, as awakened

484
00:25:52,473 --> 00:25:57,155
Speaker 1: realizers, to bear witness to that fact, to

485
00:25:57,175 --> 00:26:02,892
Speaker 1: be doubtless in the face of doubt, and it's

486
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:04,195
Speaker 1: a big part of what living the spiritual

487
00:26:04,215 --> 00:26:05,579
Speaker 1: life in earnest is all about, isn't it?

488
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:06,962
Speaker 1: Being doubtless?

489
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:11,178
Speaker 1: The ego always creates doubt and

490
00:26:11,218 --> 00:26:11,960
Speaker 1: self-concern.

491
00:26:13,871 --> 00:26:15,137
Speaker 1: And from the perspective of enlightened

492
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:16,797
Speaker 1: awareness, doubt and self-concern is a big,

493
00:26:17,824 --> 00:26:19,875
Speaker 1: overwhelming distraction from the ultimate

494
00:26:19,895 --> 00:26:20,176
Speaker 1: truth.

495
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:23,776
Speaker 1: And we don't have an infinite amount of

496
00:26:23,796 --> 00:26:24,358
Speaker 1: time to do this.

497
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,875
Speaker 1: Let's say, if we're going to live here 80,

498
00:26:25,895 --> 00:26:29,393
Speaker 1: 90 years, how much time are we going to

499
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:35,679
Speaker 1: spend with self-concern and our ego story?

500
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,576
Speaker 1: At a certain point we need to make room for

501
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:41,663
Speaker 1: this God principle in our body, mind and

502
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,325
Speaker 1: personality.

503
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:46,459
Speaker 1: We have to make room for her to make

504
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:50,413
Speaker 1: herself comfortable in our home and let her

505
00:26:50,674 --> 00:26:54,582
Speaker 1: have the big chair and let her have the big

506
00:26:54,602 --> 00:26:58,313
Speaker 1: share, let her be the one who bears witness

507
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,694
Speaker 1: to this cosmic unfolding through us and

508
00:27:00,714 --> 00:27:02,520
Speaker 1: have the courage to get out of the way.

509
00:27:13,371 --> 00:27:20,684
Speaker 1: So, in terms of becoming doubtless, can you,

510
00:27:24,705 --> 00:27:28,938
Speaker 1: can you trust unconditionally in what

511
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:31,075
Speaker 1: you've already realized is the ultimate

512
00:27:31,095 --> 00:27:35,581
Speaker 1: truth and leave it alone, absolutely and

513
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:36,102
Speaker 1: completely?

514
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:42,700
Speaker 1: But you don't need to check to make sure

515
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:47,514
Speaker 1: she's still there Because, as I was

516
00:27:47,554 --> 00:27:48,978
Speaker 1: explaining how this paradox works a few

517
00:27:49,018 --> 00:27:53,676
Speaker 1: minutes ago, it's by letting go of our

518
00:27:53,716 --> 00:27:58,895
Speaker 1: obsession with her and our doubts about

519
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:02,186
Speaker 1: whether she actually exists or not so

520
00:28:02,226 --> 00:28:04,191
Speaker 1: leaving all that alone absolutely that she

521
00:28:05,673 --> 00:28:08,917
Speaker 1: reveals herself to us in the deepest and

522
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,259
Speaker 1: most profound way imaginable.

523
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,465
Speaker 1: But in a sense, we have to prove ourselves

524
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:14,846
Speaker 1: first.

525
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:18,617
Speaker 1: We have to prove, in a sense, our faith and

526
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:21,291
Speaker 1: our worthiness to her first, because she

527
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:26,001
Speaker 1: will be able to give us the spiritual

528
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:27,504
Speaker 1: self-confidence that changes everything.

529
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,295
Speaker 1: So, getting back to what we were speaking

530
00:28:38,335 --> 00:28:41,428
Speaker 1: about earlier, about oneness at the

531
00:28:41,448 --> 00:28:44,799
Speaker 1: beginning of my talk, I find oneness a very

532
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:49,638
Speaker 1: confusing metaphor, because it's at least

533
00:28:49,678 --> 00:28:51,613
Speaker 1: in the way that I think about it, and the

534
00:28:51,653 --> 00:28:53,219
Speaker 1: fault might be mine and not yours.

535
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:59,114
Speaker 1: Oneness encourages me to think about the

536
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,301
Speaker 1: relationship between one thing and another,

537
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,836
Speaker 1: all the things that exist in the universe.

538
00:29:04,211 --> 00:29:06,360
Speaker 1: It means that I tend to think that oneness

539
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,508
Speaker 1: means all things that exist as appearing to

540
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,015
Speaker 1: be separate, are all made of the same stuff.

541
00:29:12,771 --> 00:29:14,075
Speaker 1: Because they're all made of the same stuff,

542
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,293
Speaker 1: they're not separate, which, from a physics

543
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,870
Speaker 1: point of view, might actually be true, but

544
00:29:19,911 --> 00:29:26,017
Speaker 1: it's beside the point, because non-duality

545
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:32,591
Speaker 1: points to a non-materialistic, ultimately

546
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:40,948
Speaker 1: radical realization and cognition about the

547
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:44,696
Speaker 1: nature of consciousness in a way that

548
00:29:44,737 --> 00:29:46,481
Speaker 1: cannot be cognized, it cannot be understood

549
00:29:46,501 --> 00:29:47,403
Speaker 1: with the mind at all.

550
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:51,655
Speaker 1: So, as I've been saying, the only way to

551
00:29:51,715 --> 00:29:53,260
Speaker 1: understand it is to let go of it.

552
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:56,820
Speaker 1: Not to let go of it, to forget about it,

553
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,454
Speaker 1: but to let go of it so we can become more

554
00:29:58,474 --> 00:30:02,060
Speaker 1: intimate with it which is a paradox, I know,

555
00:30:03,054 --> 00:30:07,159
Speaker 1: but that's how it actually works to become

556
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,481
Speaker 1: so, so absolutely confident that we can let

557
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:13,145
Speaker 1: go completely of our attachment to God.

558
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:14,110
Speaker 1: And through letting go of our attachment to

559
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,016
Speaker 1: God, through letting go of that attachment,

560
00:30:16,056 --> 00:30:19,398
Speaker 1: she reveals herself in the deepest way to

561
00:30:19,579 --> 00:30:19,639
Speaker 1: us.

562
00:30:21,951 --> 00:30:23,193
Speaker 1: But this is something we actually have to

563
00:30:23,253 --> 00:30:23,474
Speaker 1: do.

564
00:30:27,843 --> 00:30:31,238
Speaker 1: So a lot of spiritual practice these days

565
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,533
Speaker 1: has become very psychological.

566
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,361
Speaker 1: It's about emotional, psychological

567
00:30:36,421 --> 00:30:40,017
Speaker 1: well-being, working on our places.

568
00:30:40,058 --> 00:30:42,189
Speaker 1: We've been hurt and maybe still hurting,

569
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,007
Speaker 1: but that has nothing to do with God.

570
00:30:45,027 --> 00:30:49,620
Speaker 1: Realization God's never been hurt, wounded

571
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,738
Speaker 1: or traumatized or victimized ever by anyone,

572
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:57,997
Speaker 1: anywhere in her infinite existence and

573
00:30:58,037 --> 00:31:00,697
Speaker 1: non-existence, because she's always free.

574
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:05,178
Speaker 1: And if she is me at the highest level and

575
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:07,673
Speaker 1: she is you, it means at the highest level.

576
00:31:08,655 --> 00:31:10,119
Speaker 1: None of us have ever been hurt, wounded,

577
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:12,812
Speaker 1: traumatized or victimized either, even

578
00:31:12,832 --> 00:31:14,578
Speaker 1: though we may have been severely so on a

579
00:31:14,618 --> 00:31:16,214
Speaker 1: relative level, on an absolute level, it

580
00:31:16,254 --> 00:31:16,777
Speaker 1: never happened.

581
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:20,677
Speaker 1: And at a certain point in these 80 or 90 or

582
00:31:20,697 --> 00:31:23,010
Speaker 1: 100 years that we're going to be living, we

583
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,797
Speaker 1: might have to make a decision about whose

584
00:31:24,857 --> 00:31:25,760
Speaker 1: life we want to be living.

585
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,598
Speaker 1: Do we want to be living the life of the

586
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:31,811
Speaker 1: small self, which is relative, personal

587
00:31:31,743 --> 00:31:32,793
Speaker 1: self, which is relative, or the absolute

588
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:33,080
Speaker 1: self, which is relative.

589
00:31:33,012 --> 00:31:34,060
Speaker 1: Personal self, which is relative, or the

590
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,872
Speaker 1: absolute self, which is non-relative and

591
00:31:36,893 --> 00:31:40,198
Speaker 1: truly cosmic Literally I'm not exaggerating.

592
00:31:42,312 --> 00:31:44,216
Speaker 1: When you really wake up, you realize who I

593
00:31:44,276 --> 00:31:46,161
Speaker 1: have always been, who we have always been,

594
00:31:46,181 --> 00:31:49,894
Speaker 1: who you have always been Is a cosmically

595
00:31:49,954 --> 00:31:54,387
Speaker 1: conscious being who's awakening to him or

596
00:31:54,427 --> 00:31:55,594
Speaker 1: herself and bearing witness to him or

597
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:57,729
Speaker 1: herself through the body, mind personality

598
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,602
Speaker 1: of yourself and myself and my body mind

599
00:32:00,643 --> 00:32:02,370
Speaker 1: personality and your body mind personality

600
00:32:03,253 --> 00:32:04,878
Speaker 1: are relative appearances with relative

601
00:32:04,898 --> 00:32:08,400
Speaker 1: stories that are relatively interesting,

602
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:10,631
Speaker 1: but not absolutely interesting and not

603
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:12,076
Speaker 1: absolutely liberating, but not absolutely

604
00:32:12,177 --> 00:32:15,530
Speaker 1: interesting and not absolutely liberating.

605
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:18,858
Speaker 1: The personal self is relatively interesting,

606
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,818
Speaker 1: the absolute self is absolutely liberating.

607
00:32:23,411 --> 00:32:24,817
Speaker 1: And I think at a certain point in our

608
00:32:24,837 --> 00:32:26,811
Speaker 1: spiritual this is my opinion at a certain

609
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:28,034
Speaker 1: point in our spiritual practice, we have to

610
00:32:28,075 --> 00:32:30,757
Speaker 1: make a decision about which way we want to

611
00:32:30,777 --> 00:32:32,176
Speaker 1: go and who we want to be.

612
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,477
Speaker 1: Remember, the absolute includes the

613
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:39,014
Speaker 1: personal, but the personal doesn't include

614
00:32:39,034 --> 00:32:39,697
Speaker 1: the absolute.

615
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,575
Speaker 1: I'll say that again in case anybody missed

616
00:32:43,655 --> 00:32:46,770
Speaker 1: it the absolute includes the personal, but

617
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,256
Speaker 1: the personal doesn't include the absolute.

618
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,258
Speaker 1: And I'll say it one more time, just for

619
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,970
Speaker 1: emphasis the absolute includes the personal,

620
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,315
Speaker 1: but the personal does not include the

621
00:32:58,395 --> 00:32:58,777
Speaker 1: absolute.

622
00:32:58,797 --> 00:33:01,538
Speaker 1: So that's why I would encourage everybody

623
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:10,566
Speaker 1: who resonates with what I'm saying to I

624
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:11,970
Speaker 1: wanted to encourage you to make a decision

625
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:15,318
Speaker 1: about which way you want to go with your

626
00:33:15,358 --> 00:33:18,890
Speaker 1: life, with this body, mind and personality.

627
00:33:20,858 --> 00:33:22,626
Speaker 1: Which dimension of the reality of being

628
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:24,514
Speaker 1: human do you want to give the greatest

629
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:27,333
Speaker 1: emphasis to and the greatest importance to

630
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:27,433
Speaker 1: you?

631
00:33:55,045 --> 00:33:56,686
Speaker 1: So it takes a lot of courage to have no

632
00:33:56,747 --> 00:33:56,987
Speaker 1: doubt.

633
00:34:02,631 --> 00:34:04,215
Speaker 1: The ego becomes obsessed with doubt,

634
00:34:04,937 --> 00:34:12,423
Speaker 1: tormented by doubt, tortures itself with

635
00:34:12,463 --> 00:34:17,080
Speaker 1: doubt, and so it requires an enormous

636
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:19,129
Speaker 1: amount of spiritual self-discipline,

637
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:19,390
Speaker 1: renunciation.

638
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:21,738
Speaker 1: Remember that spiritual practice that would

639
00:34:21,758 --> 00:34:23,045
Speaker 1: awaken us to enlightened awareness is

640
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:25,574
Speaker 1: always about renunciation, which means

641
00:34:25,634 --> 00:34:28,522
Speaker 1: letting go of whatever is in the way.

642
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:36,078
Speaker 1: Not working it out, but letting it go.

643
00:34:39,112 --> 00:34:54,576
Speaker 1: Not working it out, but letting it go, as

644
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:56,040
Speaker 1: my guru told me, quoting the Buddha, he

645
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,926
Speaker 1: said as nirvana has no beginning and no end,

646
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:02,388
Speaker 1: so samsara has no beginning and no end.

647
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:07,535
Speaker 1: So think of this life that you're living

648
00:35:07,596 --> 00:35:09,300
Speaker 1: right now that's manifesting within a world

649
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:09,621
Speaker 1: space.

650
00:35:13,623 --> 00:35:15,249
Speaker 1: This life that I'm living, that Andrew's

651
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:17,373
Speaker 1: living, or any one of you are living, is

652
00:35:17,413 --> 00:35:22,924
Speaker 1: manifesting itself in a world space, and

653
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:25,422
Speaker 1: there is a world space that is a nirvanic

654
00:35:25,463 --> 00:35:26,639
Speaker 1: world space that actually exists.

655
00:35:26,552 --> 00:35:27,012
Speaker 1: That's why the Buddha spoke a nirvanic

656
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:27,318
Speaker 1: world space that actually exists.

657
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:29,461
Speaker 1: That's why the buddha spoke about nirvana

658
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:30,803
Speaker 1: because it actually exists.

659
00:35:31,845 --> 00:35:32,786
Speaker 1: Nirvana is real.

660
00:35:34,275 --> 00:35:35,339
Speaker 1: A lot of people don't believe it.

661
00:35:38,396 --> 00:35:39,379
Speaker 1: And why should you believe it?

662
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:41,323
Speaker 1: If you, if you live in a samsaric world

663
00:35:41,343 --> 00:35:44,604
Speaker 1: space, with the majority of your emotional

664
00:35:44,624 --> 00:35:48,828
Speaker 1: and psychological and psychic experience

665
00:35:48,888 --> 00:35:53,520
Speaker 1: occurs in a kind of hellacious world space

666
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,112
Speaker 1: that seems to be eternal, why should you

667
00:35:56,152 --> 00:35:56,935
Speaker 1: believe in Nirvana?

668
00:35:56,995 --> 00:35:57,738
Speaker 1: I don't blame you.

669
00:36:06,897 --> 00:36:07,643
Speaker 1: Greatest realizers have reminded us,

670
00:36:07,663 --> 00:36:11,617
Speaker 1: reminded us and repeatedly reflected back

671
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:12,820
Speaker 1: to us, that there is such a thing as a

672
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,410
Speaker 1: nirvanic world space that is also eternal.

673
00:36:19,258 --> 00:36:20,180
Speaker 1: This is something that's very hard to

674
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,564
Speaker 1: understand with the mind, with the relative

675
00:36:21,604 --> 00:36:26,521
Speaker 1: mind that thinks about everything in the

676
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:27,063
Speaker 1: short term.

677
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:31,905
Speaker 1: But when we, when we think about awakening

678
00:36:31,945 --> 00:36:33,530
Speaker 1: to enlightened awareness and non-duality

679
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:36,038
Speaker 1: and spiritual realization, we want to think

680
00:36:36,098 --> 00:36:38,580
Speaker 1: in terms of time and in a context of

681
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:38,962
Speaker 1: eternity.

682
00:36:45,722 --> 00:36:49,163
Speaker 1: So this phrase of the statement, as nirvana

683
00:36:49,203 --> 00:36:50,993
Speaker 1: has no beginning in no end, so samsara has

684
00:36:51,013 --> 00:36:51,817
Speaker 1: no beginning in no end.

685
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,696
Speaker 1: I would encourage you, to all of you, to

686
00:36:54,736 --> 00:36:59,280
Speaker 1: pay attention, to notice how true this

687
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,899
Speaker 1: actually is, notice how, in your moments of

688
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:05,719
Speaker 1: most, your mind becomes the most bright.

689
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:08,571
Speaker 1: You find yourself suddenly awake and in

690
00:37:08,591 --> 00:37:09,815
Speaker 1: touch with the deepest dimensions of

691
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:10,417
Speaker 1: reality.

692
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,138
Speaker 1: Then you realize that brightness is an echo

693
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:20,340
Speaker 1: or a reflection of the eternal nature of

694
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,022
Speaker 1: the absolute.

695
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,896
Speaker 1: It's the eternal nature of the absolute

696
00:37:24,936 --> 00:37:25,478
Speaker 1: that is so.

697
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,274
Speaker 1: It speaks of liberation, speaks of an

698
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:31,440
Speaker 1: unconditional liberation, eternal freedom.

699
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,433
Speaker 1: It's available here and now.

700
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,954
Speaker 1: Reflect upon that in your own experience,

701
00:37:38,994 --> 00:37:41,220
Speaker 1: in your own privacy, of your own mind.

702
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:44,475
Speaker 1: I see this experience is so significant

703
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:47,180
Speaker 1: because it speaks of the eternal dimension

704
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,634
Speaker 1: of reality that's timeless and the freedom

705
00:37:51,674 --> 00:37:52,297
Speaker 1: that's eternal.

706
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:57,360
Speaker 1: And then when you fall out of that Neuronic

707
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,632
Speaker 1: realm Should you be so, should this, should

708
00:38:01,672 --> 00:38:02,134
Speaker 1: that happen?

709
00:38:03,058 --> 00:38:07,156
Speaker 1: Right, when you fall back into, fall back

710
00:38:07,197 --> 00:38:09,674
Speaker 1: into relative reality notice that there are

711
00:38:09,694 --> 00:38:14,913
Speaker 1: so many concepts and beliefs that we're

712
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:17,540
Speaker 1: holding unconsciously.

713
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:22,256
Speaker 1: It seemed to paint a picture that this is

714
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:27,695
Speaker 1: reality, that this misery and the causes of

715
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:30,562
Speaker 1: this misery and the source of this misery,

716
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:34,318
Speaker 1: the nature of this misery, is also eternal

717
00:38:34,499 --> 00:38:35,401
Speaker 1: and that there's no way out.

718
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:39,475
Speaker 1: In the context of a samsaric world space,

719
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:42,863
Speaker 1: it seems that way, it feels that way, but

720
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,120
Speaker 1: when you wake up to the neurotic world

721
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,037
Speaker 1: space, you realize that was never true.

722
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,214
Speaker 1: There's different ways to think about the

723
00:38:57,254 --> 00:39:01,915
Speaker 1: human experience, and I'm speaking only in

724
00:39:01,935 --> 00:39:03,931
Speaker 1: the context of enlightenment, as I

725
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:06,539
Speaker 1: understand it, which is unique.

726
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:19,184
Speaker 1: But learn how to introspect on the nature

727
00:39:19,204 --> 00:39:22,913
Speaker 1: of your own experience and ask yourself, in

728
00:39:22,953 --> 00:39:24,906
Speaker 1: the midst of your different kinds of

729
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:26,736
Speaker 1: experiences you have throughout the day,

730
00:39:28,211 --> 00:39:29,456
Speaker 1: what's the context in which these

731
00:39:29,516 --> 00:39:31,852
Speaker 1: experiences are happening, what's the

732
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:33,277
Speaker 1: context in which I'm understanding, what's

733
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:35,755
Speaker 1: happening to me, what's happening inside me?

734
00:39:40,650 --> 00:40:02,588
Speaker 1: Is this heaven or is this hell versus how?

735
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,174
Speaker 1: So the fundamental point I wanted to make

736
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:32,491
Speaker 1: giving this talk, no-transcript with that

737
00:40:32,511 --> 00:40:34,194
Speaker 1: friend you'll never be able to see is, as

738
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:37,619
Speaker 1: I've been saying, by letting go of it, by

739
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,041
Speaker 1: having the spiritual courage, the

740
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:45,406
Speaker 1: metaphysical courage and the heroic faith

741
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:47,486
Speaker 1: to let go of it radically, absolutely and

742
00:40:47,526 --> 00:40:49,992
Speaker 1: completely, like forgetting about it, sort

743
00:40:50,052 --> 00:40:51,638
Speaker 1: of kind of like forgetting about it,

744
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,832
Speaker 1: letting, trusting in it so much that you

745
00:40:54,853 --> 00:40:57,581
Speaker 1: can let go of it absolutely, completely,

746
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:00,317
Speaker 1: because he and she is always there.

747
00:41:01,611 --> 00:41:02,956
Speaker 1: So we don't have to cling on to what's

748
00:41:02,996 --> 00:41:04,494
Speaker 1: always there, because what's always there

749
00:41:04,534 --> 00:41:04,956
Speaker 1: is always there.

750
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,399
Speaker 1: It doesn't need our attachment.

751
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:11,019
Speaker 1: That, on one hand, this is a paradox.

752
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,245
Speaker 1: On one hand, to achieve the greatest

753
00:41:12,286 --> 00:41:13,862
Speaker 1: intimacy with the ultimate mystery that

754
00:41:13,882 --> 00:41:16,597
Speaker 1: lies beyond life and death is to let go of

755
00:41:16,657 --> 00:41:16,737
Speaker 1: it.

756
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:22,699
Speaker 1: Let go of it and forget about it.

757
00:41:25,111 --> 00:41:26,095
Speaker 1: Can't really forget about it.

758
00:41:26,711 --> 00:41:27,719
Speaker 1: Let go of it and forget about it.

759
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,325
Speaker 1: Can't really forget about it.

760
00:41:28,345 --> 00:41:30,454
Speaker 1: Let go of it and forget about it, because

761
00:41:30,534 --> 00:41:32,500
Speaker 1: it's almost like your right arm.

762
00:41:34,531 --> 00:41:36,237
Speaker 1: You don't keep checking if your right arm

763
00:41:36,277 --> 00:41:36,799
Speaker 1: is there, do you?

764
00:41:39,011 --> 00:41:40,455
Speaker 1: Because you have no doubt that it's still

765
00:41:40,495 --> 00:41:41,538
Speaker 1: there and it's going to be there when you

766
00:41:41,558 --> 00:41:45,294
Speaker 1: wake up in the morning, that you don't have

767
00:41:45,314 --> 00:41:46,197
Speaker 1: to keep checking on it.

768
00:41:47,152 --> 00:41:48,079
Speaker 1: So that's one way it works when you wake up

769
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:49,126
Speaker 1: in the morning, that you don't have to keep

770
00:41:49,147 --> 00:41:49,570
Speaker 1: checking on him.

771
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:50,693
Speaker 1: So that's one way it works.

772
00:41:50,713 --> 00:41:52,117
Speaker 1: And that requires a very high degree of

773
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:54,195
Speaker 1: realization and enormous faith and enormous

774
00:41:54,235 --> 00:41:54,536
Speaker 1: trust.

775
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,130
Speaker 1: Enormous faith and enormous trust in the

776
00:41:57,151 --> 00:41:58,255
Speaker 1: friend you can never be able to see.

777
00:42:00,774 --> 00:42:02,259
Speaker 1: But the other way to do it is a paradox,

778
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,076
Speaker 1: which is something I often speak about,

779
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:13,871
Speaker 1: which is becoming a fanatic, becoming

780
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:16,015
Speaker 1: absolutely, one-pointedly focused on

781
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:19,723
Speaker 1: awakening to this absolute principle, this

782
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,834
Speaker 1: friend you'll never be able to see, all the

783
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:25,670
Speaker 1: time, allowing it to become more important

784
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,478
Speaker 1: to you than anything else and making sure

785
00:42:27,518 --> 00:42:29,333
Speaker 1: that your mind never wavers or your mind

786
00:42:29,373 --> 00:42:31,897
Speaker 1: never wanders, that you never forget about

787
00:42:31,938 --> 00:42:31,998
Speaker 1: it.

788
00:42:35,378 --> 00:42:38,510
Speaker 1: You become a true devotee of the absolute.

789
00:42:40,616 --> 00:42:43,576
Speaker 1: You're always focused on her, always

790
00:42:43,616 --> 00:42:46,155
Speaker 1: focused on her, and anything and everything

791
00:42:46,235 --> 00:42:47,719
Speaker 1: else in this world, including your own mind,

792
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:51,558
Speaker 1: is always secondary.

793
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,591
Speaker 1: Your own ego and your own mind is always

794
00:42:53,611 --> 00:42:56,379
Speaker 1: secondary and what's always primary to you

795
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,136
Speaker 1: is her and your love and devotion and

796
00:42:59,176 --> 00:42:59,959
Speaker 1: adoration of her.

797
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,252
Speaker 1: But both lead to the same result.

798
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:21,606
Speaker 1: We live in such a materialistic world these

799
00:43:21,626 --> 00:43:23,977
Speaker 1: days, such a spiritually flat world space,

800
00:43:23,997 --> 00:43:25,462
Speaker 1: that cultivating that kind of one-pointed

801
00:43:25,482 --> 00:43:27,008
Speaker 1: devotion to this absolute principle is a

802
00:43:27,048 --> 00:43:28,855
Speaker 1: little bit difficult in this world these

803
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,778
Speaker 1: days, at this time.

804
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:32,036
Speaker 1: But it doesn't mean it can't be done.

805
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:34,916
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean it can't be done.

806
00:43:41,432 --> 00:43:43,530
Speaker 1: And remember I'm almost finished, and

807
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,071
Speaker 1: remember that.

808
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,317
Speaker 1: Remember the non-duality which is what this

809
00:43:56,337 --> 00:43:58,611
Speaker 1: talk is supposed to be about, is something

810
00:43:58,631 --> 00:43:59,876
Speaker 1: that can't be understood by the mind.

811
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,695
Speaker 1: So if we spend too much time thinking about

812
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:07,335
Speaker 1: it, we can be sure we're gonna be off on

813
00:44:07,355 --> 00:44:07,977
Speaker 1: the wrong track.

814
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:19,555
Speaker 1: And the problem is so much of our

815
00:44:19,715 --> 00:44:22,962
Speaker 1: relationship to conscious existence is

816
00:44:23,022 --> 00:44:26,413
Speaker 1: predicated through the mind, takes place

817
00:44:26,453 --> 00:44:31,776
Speaker 1: through the mind, and that this mysterious

818
00:44:32,498 --> 00:44:35,763
Speaker 1: process of waking up to consciousness and

819
00:44:35,783 --> 00:44:37,231
Speaker 1: becoming conscious of consciousness and

820
00:44:37,251 --> 00:44:39,336
Speaker 1: becoming conscious of these different

821
00:44:39,356 --> 00:44:41,842
Speaker 1: dimensions of reality, relative and

822
00:44:41,902 --> 00:44:45,573
Speaker 1: absolute, require the mind to be

823
00:44:45,613 --> 00:44:47,559
Speaker 1: transcended absolutely, radically and

824
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,041
Speaker 1: completely.

825
00:44:49,631 --> 00:44:51,316
Speaker 1: And no matter how much we may speak about

826
00:44:51,938 --> 00:44:54,912
Speaker 1: transcending the mind, it's something

827
00:44:54,932 --> 00:44:56,918
Speaker 1: that's not easy to do and that few people

828
00:44:56,978 --> 00:45:00,874
Speaker 1: actually succeed at, because it's too hard

829
00:45:00,914 --> 00:45:02,478
Speaker 1: for most of us to put in the effort to

830
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:04,813
Speaker 1: transcend the mind, it seems it's just too

831
00:45:04,853 --> 00:45:08,614
Speaker 1: much of a struggle and most people give up.

832
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:13,313
Speaker 1: I tried for 10 minutes, I tried for a few

833
00:45:13,373 --> 00:45:14,998
Speaker 1: minutes, but I didn't work, so I gave up.

834
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,950
Speaker 1: You know, for this to be able to work, you

835
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:26,881
Speaker 1: have to feel that your very existence

836
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,016
Speaker 1: depends upon figuring this out, working

837
00:45:31,036 --> 00:45:31,398
Speaker 1: this out.

838
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:37,432
Speaker 1: There needs to be some a profound degree of

839
00:45:37,472 --> 00:45:38,615
Speaker 1: metaphysical urgency.

840
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,242
Speaker 1: At present.

841
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,656
Speaker 1: You have to become convinced that unless I

842
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:46,113
Speaker 1: figure this out, unless I come to terms

843
00:45:46,133 --> 00:45:50,093
Speaker 1: with this big question, life's never going

844
00:45:50,113 --> 00:45:51,814
Speaker 1: to make sense and, most importantly, my

845
00:45:51,834 --> 00:45:52,979
Speaker 1: life is never going to make sense.

846
00:45:54,753 --> 00:45:56,026
Speaker 1: And only then will you find the level of

847
00:45:56,127 --> 00:45:58,178
Speaker 1: urgency and the kind of intensity of

848
00:45:59,284 --> 00:46:01,233
Speaker 1: awakened spiritual passion and interest to

849
00:46:01,273 --> 00:46:02,752
Speaker 1: do this spiritual work, the hard spiritual

850
00:46:02,792 --> 00:46:05,000
Speaker 1: work that's necessary for all of us to do

851
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:07,619
Speaker 1: if this is going to be a successful

852
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:08,040
Speaker 1: endeavor.

853
00:46:15,112 --> 00:46:16,096
Speaker 1: I heard you were interested in

854
00:46:16,156 --> 00:46:16,597
Speaker 1: enlightenment.

855
00:46:16,637 --> 00:46:17,199
Speaker 1: How's it going?

856
00:46:19,091 --> 00:46:19,835
Speaker 1: Did you succeed?

857
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:24,936
Speaker 1: It's possible to succeed.

858
00:46:26,181 --> 00:46:27,426
Speaker 1: It's possible to succeed.

859
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,698
Speaker 1: It's possible to get to the other side of

860
00:46:29,738 --> 00:46:31,576
Speaker 1: the, to reach the yonder shore.

861
00:46:32,992 --> 00:46:34,732
Speaker 1: Once we reach the yonder shore, should such

862
00:46:34,772 --> 00:46:36,477
Speaker 1: a thing happen to us, it doesn't mean our

863
00:46:36,518 --> 00:46:40,467
Speaker 1: spiritual work is over or that our soul has

864
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:42,314
Speaker 1: been ultimately and permanently purified,

865
00:46:43,197 --> 00:46:44,513
Speaker 1: once and for all and forever, but it means

866
00:46:44,553 --> 00:46:47,170
Speaker 1: that we are no longer living in this world

867
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,676
Speaker 1: for the same reasons everyone else is.

868
00:46:51,451 --> 00:46:54,887
Speaker 1: We've flipped and we've found a completely

869
00:46:54,907 --> 00:46:56,454
Speaker 1: different relationship to the human

870
00:46:56,534 --> 00:46:57,899
Speaker 1: experience and the human existence.

871
00:47:04,812 --> 00:47:06,078
Speaker 1: So have the courage to take your own

872
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:08,430
Speaker 1: potential for liberation seriously.

873
00:47:12,241 --> 00:47:13,264
Speaker 1: You have to take, we have to be willing to

874
00:47:13,284 --> 00:47:14,869
Speaker 1: take ourselves and our own potential for

875
00:47:14,889 --> 00:47:15,691
Speaker 1: this very seriously.

876
00:47:17,155 --> 00:47:18,318
Speaker 1: Very few people are going to be willing to

877
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:22,434
Speaker 1: take, take us seriously in this area of

878
00:47:22,976 --> 00:47:23,817
Speaker 1: human potential.

879
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,602
Speaker 1: Most people don't take their own potential

880
00:47:26,622 --> 00:47:27,764
Speaker 1: for awakening very seriously.

881
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,511
Speaker 1: They're too busy doing other things.

882
00:47:54,409 --> 00:47:55,469
Speaker 1: So I'm just about to end this talk.

883
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:56,879
Speaker 1: But please, everybody, please, consider

884
00:47:56,899 --> 00:48:01,277
Speaker 1: this question that I brought up what my

885
00:48:01,297 --> 00:48:02,762
Speaker 1: guru said to me, that the only difference

886
00:48:02,782 --> 00:48:04,134
Speaker 1: between enlightenment and unenlightenment

887
00:48:04,194 --> 00:48:04,596
Speaker 1: is doubt.

888
00:48:06,995 --> 00:48:08,178
Speaker 1: Could it really be that simple?

889
00:48:08,198 --> 00:48:09,501
Speaker 1: Yes, said to me that the only difference

890
00:48:09,521 --> 00:48:10,383
Speaker 1: between enlightenment and unenlightenment

891
00:48:10,403 --> 00:48:10,764
Speaker 1: is doubt.

892
00:48:10,784 --> 00:48:11,385
Speaker 1: Could it really be that simple?

893
00:48:11,405 --> 00:48:51,742
Speaker 1: Yes, it is you, you.
