1
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:02,004
Speaker 1: And I want to talk about a very

2
00:00:02,064 --> 00:00:05,572
Speaker 1: controversial subject today, the subject of

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:06,153
Speaker 1: ego death.

4
00:00:08,021 --> 00:00:12,409
Speaker 1: And we chose the title ego death not

5
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:13,912
Speaker 1: because I really understand what it is,

6
00:00:14,694 --> 00:00:16,104
Speaker 1: because I don't think very many people do,

7
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:18,691
Speaker 1: but because it was very provocative.

8
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:24,726
Speaker 1: So this is a very controversial question

9
00:00:24,786 --> 00:00:28,734
Speaker 1: about enlightenment what happens to the ego,

10
00:00:28,794 --> 00:00:30,002
Speaker 1: and does the ego die or not?

11
00:00:30,884 --> 00:00:31,726
Speaker 1: And if it does, what is?

12
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:32,688
Speaker 1: What does it really mean?

13
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:35,341
Speaker 1: So this is something I've been thinking

14
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:37,369
Speaker 1: about for a good 35 years, so I know a

15
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:39,738
Speaker 1: little bit about it and I have a lot of

16
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:41,986
Speaker 1: experience in this area.

17
00:00:42,347 --> 00:00:44,815
Speaker 1: But uh, it's very confusing.

18
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:46,240
Speaker 1: It remains to be a confusing question

19
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,208
Speaker 1: because so many so-called experts,

20
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:53,165
Speaker 1: including me, seem to disagree with each

21
00:00:53,226 --> 00:00:54,209
Speaker 1: other about fundamentals.

22
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:58,249
Speaker 1: So this is a very confusing area.

23
00:00:58,269 --> 00:00:59,352
Speaker 1: It's a very confusing topic.

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:04,883
Speaker 1: Theoretically.

25
00:01:04,923 --> 00:01:06,451
Speaker 1: A lot of people seem to have it figured out,

26
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:09,325
Speaker 1: but I I really question whether anybody has

27
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:09,707
Speaker 1: it figured.

28
00:01:09,828 --> 00:01:11,355
Speaker 1: I have a lot of different ideas about it.

29
00:01:11,395 --> 00:01:12,701
Speaker 1: I have a lot of different thoughts which I

30
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:15,266
Speaker 1: think are important, significant, relevant

31
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:18,433
Speaker 1: and helpful, and I work with them myself to

32
00:01:18,473 --> 00:01:21,971
Speaker 1: try to make sense, out of my own experience

33
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:24,359
Speaker 1: of enlightenment, how confusing it is

34
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:27,185
Speaker 1: sometimes, and I think, if you're willing

35
00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:28,588
Speaker 1: to just consider some of the things I'm

36
00:01:28,608 --> 00:01:29,450
Speaker 1: saying, some of the my own experience of

37
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,372
Speaker 1: enlightenment, how confusing it is

38
00:01:30,392 --> 00:01:30,572
Speaker 1: sometimes.

39
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:31,775
Speaker 1: And I think if you're willing to just

40
00:01:31,795 --> 00:01:32,937
Speaker 1: consider some of the things I'm saying,

41
00:01:32,957 --> 00:01:34,180
Speaker 1: some of the paradoxes that I will present

42
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,185
Speaker 1: to you, I think it'll help you to come to

43
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:37,489
Speaker 1: terms with the question that is ultimately

44
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:38,392
Speaker 1: very mysterious.

45
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,906
Speaker 1: Because the question of what does it mean

46
00:01:41,926 --> 00:01:42,811
Speaker 1: to be what is enlightenment number one?

47
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:43,999
Speaker 1: Because the question of what does it mean

48
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:46,543
Speaker 1: to be what is enlightenment number one and

49
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:51,091
Speaker 1: what does it mean for a human being, which

50
00:01:51,171 --> 00:01:56,281
Speaker 1: is who and what we all are, to actually

51
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,144
Speaker 1: manifest enlightened awareness?

52
00:01:57,164 --> 00:02:00,060
Speaker 1: If enlightenment exists, if it's real, if

53
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,827
Speaker 1: what people like the Buddha and the Ramana

54
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:03,445
Speaker 1: Maharshi, if what they were speaking about

55
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:07,712
Speaker 1: is true, what does that miraculous and

56
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,683
Speaker 1: mysterious state of consciousness walk like

57
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:10,787
Speaker 1: and talk like and act like?

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,527
Speaker 1: And what does it have to do with the very

59
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,664
Speaker 1: real day-to-day experience of each and

60
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:17,223
Speaker 1: every one of us, especially for those of us

61
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:20,364
Speaker 1: who are doing our best to take

62
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:22,103
Speaker 1: enlightenment seriously and are taking our

63
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,729
Speaker 1: own potential for enlightenment seriously,

64
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,204
Speaker 1: for those of us who are serious about it,

65
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:29,171
Speaker 1: which not very many people are, but for

66
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:31,544
Speaker 1: those of us who are serious about it or at

67
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:32,788
Speaker 1: least believe we're serious about it.

68
00:02:32,828 --> 00:02:35,825
Speaker 1: We might be deluded, of course also, but

69
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,068
Speaker 1: for those of us who believe we're serious

70
00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:38,091
Speaker 1: about it, what does it mean to be

71
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:38,492
Speaker 1: enlightened?

72
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,661
Speaker 1: What does it look like, what does it walk

73
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:40,863
Speaker 1: like, what does it talk like, what does it

74
00:02:40,923 --> 00:02:41,343
Speaker 1: feel like?

75
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:44,087
Speaker 1: And that's always the question I've been

76
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:46,029
Speaker 1: interested in, because I was always aware

77
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:49,393
Speaker 1: that the theory I would read about, the

78
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:52,016
Speaker 1: theory of what enlightenment looks like,

79
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,823
Speaker 1: acts like, walks like and talks like, and I

80
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,125
Speaker 1: would want to know what does this really

81
00:02:57,206 --> 00:03:02,575
Speaker 1: mean about our humanity?

82
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,636
Speaker 1: How do we express this miraculous state of

83
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:07,227
Speaker 1: consciousness in and through the complexity

84
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:08,531
Speaker 1: of our human consciousness?

85
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:12,326
Speaker 1: And so, especially when I was a younger man

86
00:03:12,988 --> 00:03:16,245
Speaker 1: and I was still a seeker, I went to see as

87
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:19,673
Speaker 1: many supposedly enlightened teachers,

88
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,201
Speaker 1: masters and gurus as I could, because I

89
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:22,747
Speaker 1: wanted to know what enlightenment looked

90
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:25,325
Speaker 1: like, not just what it was like, what it

91
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:26,889
Speaker 1: was supposed to be like, from a theoretical

92
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:31,126
Speaker 1: or abstract, intellectual perspective,

93
00:03:31,146 --> 00:03:32,609
Speaker 1: philosophical perspective, but I wanted to

94
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:35,063
Speaker 1: know what enlightened human beings actually

95
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:35,465
Speaker 1: look like.

96
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:43,103
Speaker 1: And it's very confusing, because the whole

97
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:47,712
Speaker 1: notion of enlightenment emerged in two and

98
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:49,162
Speaker 1: a half thousand years ago, three thousand

99
00:03:49,203 --> 00:03:54,531
Speaker 1: years ago, during the mythic era, and so

100
00:03:56,781 --> 00:04:01,367
Speaker 1: enlightenment for many people means a state

101
00:04:01,427 --> 00:04:02,831
Speaker 1: of that which is perfect, a state of

102
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:05,705
Speaker 1: perfection, a state of that which is

103
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:08,157
Speaker 1: perfect, a state of perfection, a state of

104
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:08,519
Speaker 1: human perfection.

105
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:14,559
Speaker 1: And human perfection in the Enlightenment

106
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:17,067
Speaker 1: context usually means that the separate

107
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:19,423
Speaker 1: self-sense, the unique, separate self-sense

108
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:22,091
Speaker 1: has been utterly obliterated.

109
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:27,096
Speaker 1: And I'm just speaking metaphorically, I'm

110
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:27,820
Speaker 1: not speaking literally.

111
00:04:28,743 --> 00:04:30,428
Speaker 1: It's what we imagine in the mythic context

112
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,898
Speaker 1: that the separate ego, that the separate

113
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:36,571
Speaker 1: self-sense has been utterly and radically

114
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:40,919
Speaker 1: obliterated and what's left is a human

115
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:45,365
Speaker 1: being whose consciousness is more or less

116
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:48,191
Speaker 1: fundamentally only aware of the

117
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:52,103
Speaker 1: consciousness of cosmic unity, of what some

118
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:55,641
Speaker 1: people call God consciousness in their

119
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:57,326
Speaker 1: separate eye sense, a unique, separate eye,

120
00:04:57,346 --> 00:05:00,181
Speaker 1: sense of being, a unique ego has been

121
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:04,992
Speaker 1: utterly destroyed, once and for all and

122
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:05,373
Speaker 1: forever.

123
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,526
Speaker 1: And so to be in the presence of such a

124
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:11,647
Speaker 1: being is to be in the presence of one of

125
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:15,895
Speaker 1: God, really God appearing through the body,

126
00:05:15,936 --> 00:05:17,965
Speaker 1: mind, personality of a unique human being,

127
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:18,568
Speaker 1: man or woman.

128
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,865
Speaker 1: But it's the God consciousness which is

129
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:24,441
Speaker 1: fundamentally what's being expressed In the

130
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:26,205
Speaker 1: separate I sense, the separate ego sense,

131
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,192
Speaker 1: the personal and unique identity is gone

132
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:29,553
Speaker 1: forever.

133
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,946
Speaker 1: At least this is the mythic idea.

134
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,327
Speaker 1: And as all of us are aware of the story,

135
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:44,155
Speaker 1: that in the late 60s and 1970s, when many

136
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:48,877
Speaker 1: hippies in the late 60s and 1970s, when

137
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:51,363
Speaker 1: many hippies who discovered glimpses of

138
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:52,288
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness through the taking of

139
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:54,621
Speaker 1: ingesting psychedelic substances, traveled

140
00:05:54,662 --> 00:05:58,447
Speaker 1: to India and were seeking the company of

141
00:05:58,728 --> 00:06:00,563
Speaker 1: true enlightened masters, and they met many

142
00:06:00,624 --> 00:06:00,824
Speaker 1: of them.

143
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,845
Speaker 1: Many enlightened masters were brought back

144
00:06:02,885 --> 00:06:04,009
Speaker 1: to America and to Europe.

145
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:09,910
Speaker 1: This is when these mythic beliefs, these

146
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,268
Speaker 1: mythic ideas of the perfect state of

147
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:17,377
Speaker 1: enlightenment crashed into Western

148
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:22,966
Speaker 1: psychology and the postmodern scrutiny and

149
00:06:22,986 --> 00:06:26,442
Speaker 1: deep understanding of human nature, and

150
00:06:26,462 --> 00:06:28,067
Speaker 1: then everybody started to see that these

151
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:31,926
Speaker 1: enlightened masters were also shockingly

152
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:34,793
Speaker 1: human, not always in the best ways.

153
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:38,516
Speaker 1: There's so many examples of these kinds of

154
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:38,880
Speaker 1: stories.

155
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:43,464
Speaker 1: And then many people said well, if

156
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,409
Speaker 1: enlightened beings are especially stressing

157
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:48,864
Speaker 1: human imperfection and issues around ego

158
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:55,646
Speaker 1: and power and narcissism and the usual kind

159
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,130
Speaker 1: of weaknesses, maybe enlightenment doesn't

160
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:00,484
Speaker 1: mean anything and maybe, after all, it

161
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:01,126
Speaker 1: doesn't really exist.

162
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:05,162
Speaker 1: Maybe it's all been a myth, but that's the

163
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:08,742
Speaker 1: short story of what happened and in spite

164
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,388
Speaker 1: of that many of us kept going and didn't

165
00:07:10,408 --> 00:07:10,729
Speaker 1: give up.

166
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:17,707
Speaker 1: So that's the overarching context of the

167
00:07:17,747 --> 00:07:18,108
Speaker 1: story.

168
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:23,988
Speaker 1: So I think most people are interested in

169
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:26,387
Speaker 1: this topic, begrudgingly will admit that

170
00:07:26,427 --> 00:07:29,744
Speaker 1: enlightenment does exist, but most people

171
00:07:29,804 --> 00:07:30,968
Speaker 1: don't really know what it means.

172
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:35,566
Speaker 1: And these days a lot of people are very

173
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:39,195
Speaker 1: cynical, become very cynical about whether

174
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:40,719
Speaker 1: enlightenment is real or whether it's even

175
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,932
Speaker 1: attainable whether it's even attainable.

176
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:52,227
Speaker 1: So we're living in a context right now, in

177
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:53,691
Speaker 1: a cultural context, where I'm speaking in

178
00:07:53,731 --> 00:07:56,347
Speaker 1: broad strokes, I'm making big general

179
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:59,521
Speaker 1: statements that don't apply to everybody by

180
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,345
Speaker 1: any stretch of the imagination, and more

181
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:03,560
Speaker 1: people now tend to be interested in

182
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,566
Speaker 1: psychological healing rather than

183
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:06,850
Speaker 1: enlightenment, and they're not the same

184
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,820
Speaker 1: thing, and I really wanted to emphasize at

185
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,260
Speaker 1: the beginning of this talk that

186
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,891
Speaker 1: psychological healing is not enlightenment,

187
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,666
Speaker 1: and the awakening to enlightened awareness,

188
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,386
Speaker 1: which is what enlightenment is all about,

189
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,887
Speaker 1: is not about psychological healing.

190
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,788
Speaker 1: Psychological healing is about the attempt

191
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,153
Speaker 1: to heal our childhood wounds, unresolved

192
00:08:34,193 --> 00:08:35,664
Speaker 1: traumas and things like that, which is what

193
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:37,024
Speaker 1: everybody seems to be talking about these

194
00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:37,305
Speaker 1: days.

195
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,367
Speaker 1: But the quest for enlightenment is a search

196
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,523
Speaker 1: for the direct experience, the liberating

197
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:42,486
Speaker 1: experience, the liberating experience,

198
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:45,135
Speaker 1: experience, the liberating experience, the

199
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:47,302
Speaker 1: liberating experience, the liberating

200
00:08:47,342 --> 00:08:49,487
Speaker 1: experience of the awakening to enlightened

201
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:51,673
Speaker 1: awareness, which is a thing that exists.

202
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:54,631
Speaker 1: Enlightenment is the awakening.

203
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:56,278
Speaker 1: Enlightened awareness is a higher state of

204
00:08:56,358 --> 00:08:56,840
Speaker 1: consciousness.

205
00:08:58,164 --> 00:08:59,427
Speaker 1: It's what the buddha was pointing to, it's

206
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:00,851
Speaker 1: what he was calling all of us to, which ram

207
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:04,049
Speaker 1: maharishi was speaking about when he called

208
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:05,052
Speaker 1: awakening to the self.

209
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:09,406
Speaker 1: It's what my own guru, the great HW Alpunja,

210
00:09:09,446 --> 00:09:10,802
Speaker 1: was speaking about when he talked about

211
00:09:10,822 --> 00:09:12,649
Speaker 1: awakening to the self with a capital S.

212
00:09:15,214 --> 00:09:16,842
Speaker 1: So just to make a simple distinction that

213
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:18,549
Speaker 1: everybody is already aware of clear,

214
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,453
Speaker 1: enlightenment is about transcending the ego

215
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:26,933
Speaker 1: and the small self, and psychological work

216
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:28,159
Speaker 1: is about transcending the ego and the small

217
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:32,942
Speaker 1: self, and psychological work is about

218
00:09:32,962 --> 00:09:34,606
Speaker 1: healing the ego and the small self.

219
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:36,129
Speaker 1: I want to make clear that enlightenment is

220
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:37,072
Speaker 1: about transcendence.

221
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:39,982
Speaker 1: That's not a new idea.

222
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:41,546
Speaker 1: It's about transcending the small self

223
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:43,490
Speaker 1: completely, totally, radically and

224
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:48,752
Speaker 1: absolutely, at least for a period of time,

225
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,368
Speaker 1: and about experiencing a state of

226
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:51,217
Speaker 1: consciousness that is utterly unaffected

227
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:52,925
Speaker 1: and untouched by anything that the ego's

228
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:53,789
Speaker 1: ever experienced.

229
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,362
Speaker 1: That's why it's so liberating, because it's

230
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:56,266
Speaker 1: different territory.

231
00:09:57,784 --> 00:09:59,677
Speaker 1: It's territory where there's innocence and

232
00:09:59,717 --> 00:10:05,250
Speaker 1: purity and the presence of eternity and

233
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:07,300
Speaker 1: unthinkable and unimaginable positivity,

234
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:10,390
Speaker 1: the experience of which and the knowledge

235
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,039
Speaker 1: of which is utterly transformational.

236
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:18,024
Speaker 1: It doesn't necessarily heal the ego, but it

237
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:18,727
Speaker 1: transcends it.

238
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,637
Speaker 1: The ego temporarily disappears, doesn't die

239
00:10:22,677 --> 00:10:25,644
Speaker 1: forever, but in the state of transcendence

240
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:32,060
Speaker 1: the ego is nowhere to be found and

241
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,825
Speaker 1: psychological healing is about

242
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:35,870
Speaker 1: psychological healing and it all needs to

243
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:36,272
Speaker 1: be done.

244
00:10:36,621 --> 00:10:39,705
Speaker 1: We all need to be doing it, we want to be

245
00:10:39,745 --> 00:10:45,134
Speaker 1: happy, but I sometimes think that too many

246
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:46,560
Speaker 1: people these days are confusing

247
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:50,565
Speaker 1: psychological work with the work of

248
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:52,305
Speaker 1: transcendence, and they're not the same

249
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:52,566
Speaker 1: thing.

250
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:55,884
Speaker 1: They're both necessary and important, but

251
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:57,309
Speaker 1: they're not identical, they're not the same

252
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:58,600
Speaker 1: thing, they're very, very different.

253
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:02,004
Speaker 1: And some people are just more interested in

254
00:11:02,044 --> 00:11:05,148
Speaker 1: psychological healing, more interested in

255
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:07,698
Speaker 1: coming to terms with their woundedness and

256
00:11:07,718 --> 00:11:10,187
Speaker 1: their unresolved traumas that are still

257
00:11:10,227 --> 00:11:13,265
Speaker 1: bothering them, and that's absolutely

258
00:11:13,346 --> 00:11:14,490
Speaker 1: reasonable and totally fine.

259
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,690
Speaker 1: And some other people, myself included,

260
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:23,887
Speaker 1: have always been more interested in

261
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,322
Speaker 1: transcendence than in healing, and I know

262
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:30,627
Speaker 1: I'm not supposed to say that in polite

263
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:33,045
Speaker 1: company, but it's just true.

264
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:34,846
Speaker 1: They're not the same thing.

265
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,329
Speaker 1: And be wary or be careful when

266
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:42,281
Speaker 1: psychological healing and enlightenment are

267
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:48,328
Speaker 1: spoken about in the same breath, or when a

268
00:11:48,348 --> 00:11:50,533
Speaker 1: spiritual guru says the same thing, they're

269
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:50,773
Speaker 1: not.

270
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,566
Speaker 1: Or if a psychotherapist says the same thing,

271
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:52,988
Speaker 1: they're not.

272
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:02,090
Speaker 1: I once asked my guru, who had a very big

273
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:02,290
Speaker 1: ego.

274
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:06,111
Speaker 1: He had an enormous ego, unbelievable, and

275
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:06,674
Speaker 1: he also had a very big ego.

276
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:07,498
Speaker 1: He had an enormous ego, unbelievable, and

277
00:12:07,538 --> 00:12:09,242
Speaker 1: he also had a very big enlightenment.

278
00:12:09,322 --> 00:12:13,851
Speaker 1: His enlightenment was unimaginably huge,

279
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:15,975
Speaker 1: enormous, vast, incomprehensible,

280
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,328
Speaker 1: mysterious, overwhelming ecstasy producing.

281
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,488
Speaker 1: His enlightenment is so big that in his

282
00:12:28,508 --> 00:12:29,740
Speaker 1: presence the whole world would disappear.

283
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:33,463
Speaker 1: One felt that one was suddenly sitting at

284
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:34,488
Speaker 1: the heart of the cosmos.

285
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:42,148
Speaker 1: The spiritual energy that was vibrating in

286
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:44,623
Speaker 1: and around his physical form and through

287
00:12:44,683 --> 00:12:48,292
Speaker 1: his persona was absolutely overwhelming.

288
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:53,292
Speaker 1: I haven't before and since I've never met

289
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:55,347
Speaker 1: such a being who was so powerfully awake

290
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:57,638
Speaker 1: that could transmit this state to other

291
00:12:57,658 --> 00:13:00,541
Speaker 1: people so effortlessly, in such a way that

292
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,046
Speaker 1: a lot of people never recovered from

293
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:02,468
Speaker 1: meeting him.

294
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,423
Speaker 1: But that didn't mean he was egoless.

295
00:13:08,443 --> 00:13:09,926
Speaker 1: He seemed to be egoless when he was in

296
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:14,094
Speaker 1: these dramatic higher states, but the rest

297
00:13:14,114 --> 00:13:17,005
Speaker 1: of the time his ego was in good shape, very

298
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:18,487
Speaker 1: present and active, and sometimes not so

299
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:18,627
Speaker 1: pretty.

300
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:21,412
Speaker 1: Did that mean he wasn't enlightened?

301
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:23,816
Speaker 1: Absolutely not.

302
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:25,358
Speaker 1: It did that mean he wasn't enlightened?

303
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:26,260
Speaker 1: Absolutely not.

304
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,526
Speaker 1: It did not mean he wasn't enlightened.

305
00:13:28,021 --> 00:13:29,947
Speaker 1: This is the whole paradox I'm trying to

306
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:31,231
Speaker 1: bring to all of you.

307
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,446
Speaker 1: It didn't mean he wasn't enlightened.

308
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:37,828
Speaker 1: It meant he had issues, like so many of us

309
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:37,969
Speaker 1: do.

310
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:39,566
Speaker 1: He had big issues.

311
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,915
Speaker 1: He was a very powerful man, for better and

312
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:43,299
Speaker 1: for worse.

313
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:44,216
Speaker 1: He was a very powerful man for better and

314
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:44,420
Speaker 1: for worse.

315
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:49,940
Speaker 1: But his awakening to enlightened awareness

316
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:51,720
Speaker 1: was undoubtable.

317
00:13:51,841 --> 00:13:53,575
Speaker 1: It was impossible to doubt or impossible to

318
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:58,781
Speaker 1: question, because when he was vibrating it

319
00:13:58,801 --> 00:13:59,705
Speaker 1: was like sitting in front of God.

320
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:05,373
Speaker 1: Time and space seemed to warp around him.

321
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:07,789
Speaker 1: And they did.

322
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,190
Speaker 1: And the day I met him, which is March 25th

323
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,880
Speaker 1: 1986, is the day my life changed forever

324
00:14:14,643 --> 00:14:16,443
Speaker 1: simply because I met him and experienced

325
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:19,806
Speaker 1: his grace and sat in front of him and as a

326
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:23,377
Speaker 1: result of that meeting, I had an experience

327
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:25,567
Speaker 1: of awakening after about 10 minutes.

328
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:34,404
Speaker 1: So I asked him during my early weeks with

329
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:34,545
Speaker 1: him.

330
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:37,414
Speaker 1: I said with enlightenment?

331
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:39,806
Speaker 1: I said does the ego die?

332
00:14:41,852 --> 00:14:43,481
Speaker 1: And he said no, the ego doesn't die, but it

333
00:14:43,521 --> 00:14:44,606
Speaker 1: becomes sattvic.

334
00:14:44,821 --> 00:14:49,288
Speaker 1: Sattvic means peaceful, he said so the

335
00:14:49,328 --> 00:14:50,731
Speaker 1: effect of enlightened awareness is that the

336
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:53,969
Speaker 1: ego becomes pacified.

337
00:14:55,991 --> 00:14:57,680
Speaker 1: So it doesn't die, but it becomes pacified.

338
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:12,393
Speaker 1: So so, so one of the points I wanted to

339
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:17,159
Speaker 1: make in this talk was that in the

340
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:21,617
Speaker 1: therapeutic context, we want to understand

341
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:22,100
Speaker 1: why we're suffering.

342
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,265
Speaker 1: We want to come to an understanding of why

343
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:23,767
Speaker 1: we're suffering.

344
00:15:24,622 --> 00:15:27,570
Speaker 1: What are the issues or the events that

345
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,158
Speaker 1: happened in our past that created very

346
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:33,147
Speaker 1: negative impressions in our nervous systems

347
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:33,969
Speaker 1: and in our souls?

348
00:15:35,695 --> 00:15:37,059
Speaker 1: As long as they remain unresolved, they're

349
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,742
Speaker 1: going to continue to cause us trouble and

350
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:40,785
Speaker 1: cause us to suffer.

351
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:42,948
Speaker 1: In the present moment.

352
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:48,075
Speaker 1: With the awakening to enlightened awareness,

353
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,862
Speaker 1: what happens is that the awakening to

354
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:56,950
Speaker 1: higher consciousness reveals what's

355
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,644
Speaker 1: instantly recognized to be a much deeper

356
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,570
Speaker 1: dimension of reality.

357
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:05,064
Speaker 1: What experiences?

358
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:15,831
Speaker 1: It seems like a deeper truth, not only

359
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:19,102
Speaker 1: about oneself and one's history, but about

360
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:23,323
Speaker 1: life itself, about existence and the

361
00:16:23,363 --> 00:16:25,121
Speaker 1: discovery of this deeper truth about

362
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:29,161
Speaker 1: reality, about life and existence, is so

363
00:16:29,282 --> 00:16:32,102
Speaker 1: unthinkably positive, so unthinkably

364
00:16:32,162 --> 00:16:34,329
Speaker 1: positive that it, at least temporarily,

365
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,810
Speaker 1: displaces our obsession with our own

366
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,205
Speaker 1: suffering, obsession with our own misery,

367
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,958
Speaker 1: and obsession with our own misery and our

368
00:16:47,978 --> 00:16:58,669
Speaker 1: obsession with our own pain, and so and so,

369
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:05,616
Speaker 1: once this happens, we want to see well,

370
00:17:05,636 --> 00:17:10,580
Speaker 1: what can I do to, what do I need to do to

371
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,526
Speaker 1: remain conscious of this deeper truth that

372
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:16,273
Speaker 1: becomes what spiritual practice is all

373
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:16,454
Speaker 1: about?

374
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:18,753
Speaker 1: What is it that we need to do?

375
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:19,515
Speaker 1: What is it that I need to do?

376
00:17:19,536 --> 00:17:21,209
Speaker 1: What is it that I need to do in order to

377
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,834
Speaker 1: remain conscious of this deeper truth?

378
00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:27,012
Speaker 1: Because if I'm conscious of this deeper

379
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:32,886
Speaker 1: truth, my obsession with my own egos, pain

380
00:17:32,906 --> 00:17:35,779
Speaker 1: and suffering and misery and grief will be

381
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,305
Speaker 1: displaced.

382
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:49,846
Speaker 1: Grief will be displaced and usually the

383
00:17:49,866 --> 00:17:51,650
Speaker 1: intensity of that state of consciousness

384
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,014
Speaker 1: will continue to displace our experience of

385
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:54,678
Speaker 1: pain and suffering and misery and grief.

386
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:59,013
Speaker 1: Now, of course, some people say, a lot of

387
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,530
Speaker 1: people say, especially psychotherapists say

388
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:03,752
Speaker 1: that those individuals who are obsessed

389
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:07,436
Speaker 1: with higher states of consciousness are

390
00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:09,144
Speaker 1: using their experiences of these higher

391
00:18:09,164 --> 00:18:11,453
Speaker 1: states to spiritually bypass or to avoid

392
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:15,289
Speaker 1: their own shadows, their own unresolved

393
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:15,651
Speaker 1: issues.

394
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:20,907
Speaker 1: And if that's true, if that's true, if

395
00:18:20,927 --> 00:18:23,506
Speaker 1: that's true and often it is true that would

396
00:18:23,526 --> 00:18:26,329
Speaker 1: mean that our spiritual part, part of a

397
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:27,834
Speaker 1: fundamental part of our spiritual practice,

398
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:34,930
Speaker 1: would have to be facing the difficult

399
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,030
Speaker 1: truths about ourselves that we tend to like

400
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:37,491
Speaker 1: to avoid.

401
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:41,871
Speaker 1: And just in case anybody's wondering about

402
00:18:42,674 --> 00:18:44,689
Speaker 1: my approach to all this, in my own teaching

403
00:18:44,729 --> 00:18:50,574
Speaker 1: work of evolutionary enlightenment I have

404
00:18:50,614 --> 00:18:52,218
Speaker 1: five fundamental principles that I work

405
00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:55,739
Speaker 1: with, and the first is cultivating the

406
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,626
Speaker 1: unconditional desire for liberation, first

407
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:01,114
Speaker 1: and foremost, as a first principle, one's

408
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:03,328
Speaker 1: relationship to existence, into life itself.

409
00:19:03,985 --> 00:19:05,349
Speaker 1: I wanna be free more than anything else.

410
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:08,287
Speaker 1: First and foremost, more than I wanna be

411
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:11,625
Speaker 1: rich, more than I wanna be famous, more

412
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:16,811
Speaker 1: than I wanna be anything, I wanna be free.

413
00:19:16,971 --> 00:19:18,095
Speaker 1: I wanna know what the Buddha knew.

414
00:19:20,946 --> 00:19:22,690
Speaker 1: But the second says if you want to be free,

415
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:25,277
Speaker 1: if you truly want to be free, you have to

416
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:28,090
Speaker 1: learn to take responsibility from all of

417
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:32,618
Speaker 1: your karma, all of your karma past, present

418
00:19:32,658 --> 00:19:33,379
Speaker 1: and even future.

419
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:36,431
Speaker 1: Because if you're aspiring anybody who's

420
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:38,320
Speaker 1: aspiring to become a bodhisattva also have

421
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,106
Speaker 1: to take responsibility for what has yet to

422
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:42,472
Speaker 1: happen for the future.

423
00:19:43,554 --> 00:19:44,817
Speaker 1: So the second principle of the teaching

424
00:19:44,857 --> 00:19:46,289
Speaker 1: tells us if we want to be free, we have to

425
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,560
Speaker 1: be willing to take on conditional, absolute

426
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,187
Speaker 1: and radical responsibility for our karma

427
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,736
Speaker 1: coming from our past, present and also the

428
00:19:56,776 --> 00:19:57,116
Speaker 1: future.

429
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:01,980
Speaker 1: And the third principle that I teach is if

430
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,861
Speaker 1: we want to take responsibility for karma

431
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,122
Speaker 1: past, present and future how are we going

432
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:05,362
Speaker 1: to do it?

433
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:07,110
Speaker 1: The only way to do it is going to be by

434
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,926
Speaker 1: facing everything and avoiding nothing, and

435
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:13,873
Speaker 1: that is not an easy form of spiritual

436
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:14,555
Speaker 1: practice to do.

437
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,091
Speaker 1: It says if you want to be free, more than

438
00:20:17,111 --> 00:20:18,469
Speaker 1: anything else, you have to face everything

439
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:19,173
Speaker 1: and avoid nothing.

440
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:21,504
Speaker 1: We have to learn how to face everything and

441
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:26,153
Speaker 1: avoid nothing, and speaking about it is one

442
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:28,618
Speaker 1: thing, doing it is another.

443
00:20:31,824 --> 00:20:37,776
Speaker 1: It's very difficult because the ego, your

444
00:20:37,857 --> 00:20:41,533
Speaker 1: ego, my ego, the ego tends to have a great

445
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,419
Speaker 1: resistance and reluctance to face

446
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,829
Speaker 1: everything and avoid nothing, especially

447
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,381
Speaker 1: issues about ourselves that make us feel

448
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:50,614
Speaker 1: uncomfortable or ill at ease, that don't

449
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:51,865
Speaker 1: make us feel so good about ourselves.

450
00:20:54,214 --> 00:20:55,680
Speaker 1: So facing everything and avoiding nothing

451
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,015
Speaker 1: requires a lot of humility and a depth of

452
00:21:00,502 --> 00:21:05,436
Speaker 1: resolve for purification at the level of

453
00:21:05,476 --> 00:21:05,897
Speaker 1: the soul.

454
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:07,872
Speaker 1: It's not for the faint of heart.

455
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:24,498
Speaker 1: So one thing to understand that the in

456
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:28,493
Speaker 1: terms of the, in terms of this distinction

457
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:32,256
Speaker 1: I'm making in this talk between the

458
00:21:32,316 --> 00:21:33,381
Speaker 1: enlightenment perspective and the

459
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:43,475
Speaker 1: therapeutic perspective, is that when we're

460
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:48,901
Speaker 1: trying to heal the ego when we're trying to

461
00:21:48,961 --> 00:21:50,808
Speaker 1: heal it in a psychological context.

462
00:21:50,868 --> 00:21:55,477
Speaker 1: If you work with a good therapist, you

463
00:21:55,517 --> 00:21:56,319
Speaker 1: won't demonize it.

464
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:58,591
Speaker 1: You won't demonize the ego.

465
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:02,392
Speaker 1: That'll just make the division or the split

466
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:08,427
Speaker 1: in the self even deeper, because of course

467
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:10,293
Speaker 1: the goal in the therapeutic context is for

468
00:22:10,313 --> 00:22:12,688
Speaker 1: the wounded self that's become divided

469
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,774
Speaker 1: against itself to become healed and become

470
00:22:14,815 --> 00:22:20,167
Speaker 1: whole, to reunify with itself in the

471
00:22:20,187 --> 00:22:22,170
Speaker 1: attempt to resolve the trauma, resolve the

472
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:22,571
Speaker 1: split.

473
00:22:26,758 --> 00:22:37,234
Speaker 1: But I'm losing track on my direction here.

474
00:22:37,285 --> 00:22:38,066
Speaker 1: Just give me a second.

475
00:22:55,181 --> 00:23:01,411
Speaker 1: Yes, but what happens?

476
00:23:01,431 --> 00:23:02,273
Speaker 1: What I wanted to say is that the this is

477
00:23:02,313 --> 00:23:03,576
Speaker 1: something that not a lot of people know

478
00:23:03,597 --> 00:23:07,571
Speaker 1: about is that, from the perspective of

479
00:23:07,591 --> 00:23:08,438
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness, when you awaken to

480
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:11,931
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness within yourself, when

481
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:13,635
Speaker 1: you awaken to enlightened awareness within

482
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:15,630
Speaker 1: yourself, when you start seeing, perceiving

483
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:18,167
Speaker 1: reality through a different lens lens of

484
00:23:18,187 --> 00:23:22,691
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness itself you start to

485
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:25,717
Speaker 1: find the presence of the ego or separate

486
00:23:25,757 --> 00:23:29,235
Speaker 1: self-sense, especially in individuals that

487
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,045
Speaker 1: are particularly and uniquely identified

488
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,526
Speaker 1: with their separate self-sense and

489
00:23:33,566 --> 00:23:35,839
Speaker 1: individuals who have particularly

490
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:36,945
Speaker 1: narcissistic tendencies.

491
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:42,671
Speaker 1: From the perspective of the awakening to

492
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:43,787
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness, seen through the

493
00:23:43,827 --> 00:23:46,788
Speaker 1: lens of enlightened awareness, the ego is

494
00:23:46,828 --> 00:23:51,276
Speaker 1: seen as an obstruction.

495
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:59,026
Speaker 1: I remember when I was I'm 67 now, so I

496
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:00,609
Speaker 1: started experimenting with psychedelic

497
00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:03,476
Speaker 1: drugs when I was far too young, when I was

498
00:24:03,516 --> 00:24:04,318
Speaker 1: about 16.

499
00:24:09,106 --> 00:24:10,990
Speaker 1: I took a very powerful dose of LSD and I

500
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,998
Speaker 1: remember a friend of mine had a very big

501
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:15,239
Speaker 1: ego.

502
00:24:16,646 --> 00:24:19,618
Speaker 1: He was quite a narcissistic character and

503
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:20,943
Speaker 1: me and a bunch of my friends were in the

504
00:24:20,984 --> 00:24:22,822
Speaker 1: country and we took a particularly large

505
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,812
Speaker 1: dose of this powerful psychedelic drug.

506
00:24:26,045 --> 00:24:28,326
Speaker 1: And I remember when my friend walked in I'm

507
00:24:28,346 --> 00:24:29,711
Speaker 1: sure many of you have had this kind of

508
00:24:29,731 --> 00:24:33,350
Speaker 1: experience His ego was.

509
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:40,752
Speaker 1: It was so ugly and I suddenly saw, I saw it.

510
00:24:41,086 --> 00:24:42,670
Speaker 1: I saw it through the lens of this kind of

511
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,736
Speaker 1: psychedelic state.

512
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:48,406
Speaker 1: I saw his ego as this monstrosity, as this

513
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:50,975
Speaker 1: ugly creature or appendage.

514
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:55,191
Speaker 1: It was particularly shocking and

515
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:55,934
Speaker 1: particularly painful.

516
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:58,517
Speaker 1: Of course this was the effect of the

517
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:00,045
Speaker 1: psychedelic substance.

518
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:03,012
Speaker 1: Of course animated this particular

519
00:25:04,456 --> 00:25:05,117
Speaker 1: reactivity.

520
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:09,193
Speaker 1: But when we awaken to enlightened awareness,

521
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:20,687
Speaker 1: the ego is felt to be an obstacle, it's

522
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,093
Speaker 1: suddenly seen as not our friend.

523
00:25:23,445 --> 00:25:26,810
Speaker 1: So it's not because the, because the

524
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,096
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness has its own

525
00:25:29,156 --> 00:25:29,758
Speaker 1: self-sense.

526
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:32,153
Speaker 1: When you awaken to enlightened awareness,

527
00:25:32,445 --> 00:25:33,811
Speaker 1: you awaken to a different part of your own

528
00:25:33,871 --> 00:25:36,047
Speaker 1: self, and a different part of your own self

529
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:39,915
Speaker 1: has particular sensibilities, preferences,

530
00:25:41,317 --> 00:25:42,179
Speaker 1: likes and dislikes.

531
00:25:43,605 --> 00:25:45,121
Speaker 1: And so when you awaken to enlightened

532
00:25:45,162 --> 00:25:47,211
Speaker 1: awareness, in similar ways as to how

533
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:49,229
Speaker 1: reality can seem from the perspective of

534
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:53,273
Speaker 1: being in a trance state activated by

535
00:25:53,293 --> 00:25:56,633
Speaker 1: psychedelic substances, you can become more

536
00:25:56,713 --> 00:25:58,686
Speaker 1: sensitive to particular issues that

537
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:00,513
Speaker 1: ordinarily would not be bothersome.

538
00:26:01,949 --> 00:26:03,353
Speaker 1: So I just wanted to make this point that

539
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:06,944
Speaker 1: while in a therapeutic context we want to

540
00:26:06,964 --> 00:26:09,512
Speaker 1: befriend the ego and don't want to alienate

541
00:26:09,572 --> 00:26:11,920
Speaker 1: it, so we can help to serve its

542
00:26:12,742 --> 00:26:17,154
Speaker 1: reunification with itself, heal the wounds,

543
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:22,918
Speaker 1: when we see the ego from a deeply awakened

544
00:26:22,938 --> 00:26:25,249
Speaker 1: state of enlightened awareness, we see the

545
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,498
Speaker 1: problem that it is because it wants to

546
00:26:28,538 --> 00:26:29,245
Speaker 1: remain separate.

547
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,814
Speaker 1: It stands against cosmic unity.

548
00:26:33,099 --> 00:26:34,489
Speaker 1: Unknowingly, it can't help.

549
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:34,610
Speaker 1: It.

550
00:26:35,354 --> 00:26:36,002
Speaker 1: It's not deliberate.

551
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:42,186
Speaker 1: It's not deliberate or intentional, it's

552
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:43,531
Speaker 1: just that its entire position in

553
00:26:43,571 --> 00:26:45,088
Speaker 1: relationship to existence and to life

554
00:26:45,148 --> 00:26:48,336
Speaker 1: itself is to stand apart and to be separate.

555
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:58,285
Speaker 1: It doesn't want to die, drown in love, it

556
00:26:58,305 --> 00:27:00,572
Speaker 1: does not want to disappear into our

557
00:27:00,693 --> 00:27:01,876
Speaker 1: absolute or cosmic unity.

558
00:27:07,307 --> 00:27:08,653
Speaker 1: So when we awaken to enlightened awareness,

559
00:27:08,685 --> 00:27:13,092
Speaker 1: we discover that the ego can be very

560
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:17,169
Speaker 1: problematic for us, especially if we also

561
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,256
Speaker 1: are very interested in enlightenment.

562
00:27:21,165 --> 00:27:22,430
Speaker 1: Ironically, the more interested in

563
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,168
Speaker 1: enlightenment you are, the more serious you

564
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:27,372
Speaker 1: are about it, the more problematic the ego

565
00:27:27,392 --> 00:27:27,894
Speaker 1: can become.

566
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:33,925
Speaker 1: Because even though the ego doesn't die at

567
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:36,112
Speaker 1: least in my experience and most of the

568
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:40,571
Speaker 1: others I've observed the ego has to somehow,

569
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:43,387
Speaker 1: in some mysterious way has to be

570
00:27:45,713 --> 00:27:48,929
Speaker 1: experientially convinced, or you, whoever

571
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:51,979
Speaker 1: you are, have to be experientially

572
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,614
Speaker 1: convinced about that which is higher and

573
00:27:55,654 --> 00:27:57,772
Speaker 1: more real, in such a way that your ego will

574
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,314
Speaker 1: willingly step aside and become second

575
00:28:03,334 --> 00:28:03,615
Speaker 1: fiddle.

576
00:28:08,726 --> 00:28:10,252
Speaker 1: The ego always wants to be the star of its

577
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:10,714
Speaker 1: own movie.

578
00:28:12,366 --> 00:28:19,192
Speaker 1: Like I've been saying for many years, our

579
00:28:19,273 --> 00:28:20,896
Speaker 1: narcissism, which is arrogant

580
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:24,811
Speaker 1: self-importance, undeserved, unearned,

581
00:28:25,052 --> 00:28:26,035
Speaker 1: arrogant self-importance.

582
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:33,414
Speaker 1: For our postmodern, conditioned narcissism,

583
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:41,649
Speaker 1: which is the unearned superiority it means.

584
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:43,355
Speaker 1: I want to be able to stand out and be seen

585
00:28:43,746 --> 00:28:45,351
Speaker 1: as being separate from the other, the

586
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:46,775
Speaker 1: others, the world and the whole universe.

587
00:28:48,606 --> 00:28:50,592
Speaker 1: It's a desire to stand out and away from

588
00:28:50,632 --> 00:28:53,392
Speaker 1: the whole, or the others or the world.

589
00:28:55,966 --> 00:28:57,169
Speaker 1: I want you to see me.

590
00:28:58,874 --> 00:29:02,011
Speaker 1: I don't want to disappear, I don't want to

591
00:29:02,051 --> 00:29:04,519
Speaker 1: die into the infinite, that which is

592
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:04,844
Speaker 1: eternal.

593
00:29:05,628 --> 00:29:06,572
Speaker 1: I want you to see me.

594
00:29:09,451 --> 00:29:10,854
Speaker 1: And the ego doesn't want to let go of its

595
00:29:10,995 --> 00:29:12,686
Speaker 1: own uniqueness, its own specialness, its

596
00:29:12,826 --> 00:29:14,573
Speaker 1: own separateness.

597
00:29:19,752 --> 00:29:21,996
Speaker 1: And it's a contrary position to the very

598
00:29:23,438 --> 00:29:25,040
Speaker 1: inner momentum of enlightened awareness

599
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,308
Speaker 1: itself, because enlightened awareness is

600
00:29:28,348 --> 00:29:33,696
Speaker 1: the feeling or the sense, the momentum of

601
00:29:33,836 --> 00:29:35,258
Speaker 1: unity, which is the ultimate nature of

602
00:29:35,298 --> 00:29:37,101
Speaker 1: reality, the ultimate nature of the cosmos.

603
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:40,188
Speaker 1: The ultimate truth about the cosmos is the

604
00:29:40,248 --> 00:29:42,835
Speaker 1: principle truth that Vedanta speaks so

605
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:43,497
Speaker 1: loudly about.

606
00:29:44,645 --> 00:29:46,152
Speaker 1: Vedanta tells us that the ultimate truth

607
00:29:46,206 --> 00:29:47,727
Speaker 1: about the nature of reality is that there's

608
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:48,591
Speaker 1: only one and not two.

609
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:51,752
Speaker 1: And I am, and you all are that one without

610
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:52,193
Speaker 1: a second.

611
00:29:53,156 --> 00:30:03,013
Speaker 1: I am that, and the ego says no, I'm not, no,

612
00:30:03,054 --> 00:30:04,076
Speaker 1: I'm not and no, I won't.

613
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,919
Speaker 1: So then, of course, if, if this is the

614
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:11,343
Speaker 1: situation, then of course you need a

615
00:30:11,383 --> 00:30:13,388
Speaker 1: spiritual teacher, a spiritual master,

616
00:30:13,408 --> 00:30:14,972
Speaker 1: someone who's actually crossed this rubric

617
00:30:15,073 --> 00:30:19,071
Speaker 1: on, who could help you to deal with these

618
00:30:20,274 --> 00:30:22,086
Speaker 1: conflicting motives in your own self, the

619
00:30:22,106 --> 00:30:23,055
Speaker 1: part of you that wants to be

620
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:25,750
Speaker 1: unconditionally free and liberated, wants

621
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,328
Speaker 1: to die in love and cosmic unity once and

622
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:29,792
Speaker 1: for all and forever, eternally, for

623
00:30:29,812 --> 00:30:31,276
Speaker 1: eternity, never to return again.

624
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,386
Speaker 1: And your ego's refusal to let go to

625
00:30:37,427 --> 00:30:38,705
Speaker 1: relinquish its own power.

626
00:30:38,745 --> 00:30:39,486
Speaker 1: And the ego's refusal to let go to

627
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,048
Speaker 1: relinquish its own power.

628
00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:43,832
Speaker 1: So for the enlightenment, for the awakening

629
00:30:43,872 --> 00:30:45,595
Speaker 1: to enlighten awareness to become stable.

630
00:30:45,615 --> 00:30:48,198
Speaker 1: In other words, a lot of people find it

631
00:30:48,258 --> 00:30:55,577
Speaker 1: easy, given the right circumstances, to

632
00:30:55,598 --> 00:30:57,826
Speaker 1: awaken briefly and temporarily, but usually

633
00:30:57,846 --> 00:30:58,708
Speaker 1: the awakening to enlightened awareness is a

634
00:30:58,728 --> 00:31:00,012
Speaker 1: brief flight from the torment and the

635
00:31:00,072 --> 00:31:01,396
Speaker 1: tyranny of the ego story.

636
00:31:02,732 --> 00:31:04,440
Speaker 1: Most people fall back again very quickly

637
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,051
Speaker 1: into the ego's world, wondering where did

638
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:07,553
Speaker 1: it all go?

639
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,175
Speaker 1: So for the enlightenment to be able to

640
00:31:11,235 --> 00:31:13,932
Speaker 1: stick for one's spiritual self-confidence.

641
00:31:13,993 --> 00:31:16,054
Speaker 1: To be able to stick for the spiritual

642
00:31:16,094 --> 00:31:17,223
Speaker 1: self-confidence, to be able to become

643
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:19,911
Speaker 1: strong, the ego has to be.

644
00:31:20,092 --> 00:31:21,776
Speaker 1: It's very simple really, but it's very

645
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:22,197
Speaker 1: difficult.

646
00:31:22,305 --> 00:31:23,811
Speaker 1: The ego has to be willing to become second

647
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:27,631
Speaker 1: fiddle, not first fiddle, not star of the

648
00:31:27,651 --> 00:31:28,273
Speaker 1: movie anymore.

649
00:31:28,365 --> 00:31:30,927
Speaker 1: You can be here if you want, but you've got

650
00:31:30,947 --> 00:31:35,883
Speaker 1: to become number two, second, best, second,

651
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:36,185
Speaker 1: important.

652
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:43,725
Speaker 1: Your importance is no longer primary, it

653
00:31:43,765 --> 00:31:44,827
Speaker 1: needs to become secondary and ego.

654
00:31:44,847 --> 00:31:45,849
Speaker 1: Most people, most people at the level of

655
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:46,731
Speaker 1: ego, would rather die and give up being the

656
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:48,273
Speaker 1: most special one in the whole universe,

657
00:31:50,197 --> 00:31:52,466
Speaker 1: because the ego thrives on being special.

658
00:31:53,848 --> 00:31:55,151
Speaker 1: Can you see how special I am?

659
00:31:56,233 --> 00:31:57,835
Speaker 1: I'm either special because I'm more

660
00:31:57,935 --> 00:31:59,798
Speaker 1: talented, more intelligent, more beautiful,

661
00:32:00,705 --> 00:32:02,992
Speaker 1: because I'm more traumatized, more screwed

662
00:32:03,093 --> 00:32:04,989
Speaker 1: up and I suffer more than you.

663
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,412
Speaker 1: The ego doesn't really care how it can be

664
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:10,234
Speaker 1: seen as special.

665
00:32:11,165 --> 00:32:12,871
Speaker 1: It'll do anything to hold onto the position

666
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:14,667
Speaker 1: of being seen as special, even if it means

667
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,135
Speaker 1: it's a result of pain and suffering.

668
00:32:17,847 --> 00:32:18,911
Speaker 1: It's ironic and tragic.

669
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:25,636
Speaker 1: So the big challenge is you, whoever you

670
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:28,566
Speaker 1: are and this is true for all of us, if we

671
00:32:28,606 --> 00:32:30,172
Speaker 1: want to be able to awaken to enlightened

672
00:32:30,232 --> 00:32:31,728
Speaker 1: awareness in such a way that it will become

673
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:38,170
Speaker 1: relatively stable is that we have to be

674
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:38,932
Speaker 1: willing to die.

675
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:44,852
Speaker 1: Our ego has to be willing to relinquish its

676
00:32:44,972 --> 00:32:49,673
Speaker 1: irrational need to be number one within the

677
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:50,776
Speaker 1: story of your own life.

678
00:32:54,685 --> 00:32:57,331
Speaker 1: So if there's anything, if ego death is

679
00:32:57,431 --> 00:33:02,733
Speaker 1: real, then I can see this in people when

680
00:33:02,753 --> 00:33:05,705
Speaker 1: they you can tell if you meet a true seeker

681
00:33:05,805 --> 00:33:07,051
Speaker 1: or someone who's a true finder.

682
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:11,756
Speaker 1: In most true finders there's a softness in

683
00:33:11,796 --> 00:33:13,222
Speaker 1: their persona and their personality.

684
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:14,891
Speaker 1: The way the personality expresses itself is

685
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:22,417
Speaker 1: a softness and a kindness that reflects

686
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:24,707
Speaker 1: that they've let go significantly at the

687
00:33:24,747 --> 00:33:25,691
Speaker 1: deepest level of their being.

688
00:33:26,026 --> 00:33:27,131
Speaker 1: A big letting go has happened.

689
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:28,671
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean it's an unconditioned,

690
00:33:28,805 --> 00:33:29,930
Speaker 1: absolute letting go of the ego.

691
00:33:31,286 --> 00:33:32,531
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean they're fully enlightened

692
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:36,190
Speaker 1: for eternity, whatever that means, but it

693
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:40,644
Speaker 1: means their soul.

694
00:33:41,326 --> 00:33:42,925
Speaker 1: It means they've allowed their soul to

695
00:33:42,965 --> 00:33:46,655
Speaker 1: become wounded by the love of God, so to

696
00:33:46,696 --> 00:33:49,691
Speaker 1: speak, the love of the infinite, the love

697
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:50,433
Speaker 1: of the absolute.

698
00:33:51,247 --> 00:33:55,578
Speaker 1: They've allowed that which is primary and

699
00:33:55,678 --> 00:34:04,587
Speaker 1: absolute to take the first place and that

700
00:34:05,228 --> 00:34:06,290
Speaker 1: they have humbled themselves before God in

701
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:10,018
Speaker 1: an essential, a fundamental, irreducible

702
00:34:10,058 --> 00:34:10,279
Speaker 1: way.

703
00:34:11,306 --> 00:34:12,901
Speaker 1: And this doesn't mean that the ego is gone

704
00:34:12,942 --> 00:34:15,894
Speaker 1: forever, it doesn't mean it's left the room,

705
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:19,271
Speaker 1: but it means that you can feel the humility

706
00:34:22,725 --> 00:34:23,448
Speaker 1: in the true seeker.

707
00:34:24,505 --> 00:34:27,625
Speaker 1: This is a certain kind of arrogance that

708
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:31,248
Speaker 1: they have seen to have transcended, at

709
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,606
Speaker 1: least in a significant way, and that's

710
00:34:32,626 --> 00:34:33,789
Speaker 1: because there's been a deep measure of

711
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:37,151
Speaker 1: surrender through this higher principle.

712
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:41,370
Speaker 1: And of course, once that surrender has

713
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,010
Speaker 1: happened, once it's taken place, once a

714
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,587
Speaker 1: decision has been made, once that letting

715
00:34:44,607 --> 00:34:46,848
Speaker 1: go has happened, doesn't mean one has

716
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,526
Speaker 1: reached the yonder shore and never to

717
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:51,626
Speaker 1: return again or anything like that, but it

718
00:34:51,646 --> 00:34:53,365
Speaker 1: means now one's spiritual practice is

719
00:34:53,445 --> 00:34:55,311
Speaker 1: working on letting go more and more and

720
00:34:55,351 --> 00:35:02,620
Speaker 1: more and more and more, but at least one

721
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,793
Speaker 1: now is living in the momentum of

722
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:06,495
Speaker 1: transcendence.

723
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:13,085
Speaker 1: And it means that one's pride and arrogance

724
00:35:13,206 --> 00:35:16,851
Speaker 1: has been punctured, not ultimately defeated,

725
00:35:16,871 --> 00:35:17,353
Speaker 1: but punctured.

726
00:35:17,445 --> 00:35:21,173
Speaker 1: It means it's been wounded in a good way,

727
00:35:22,676 --> 00:35:24,540
Speaker 1: spiritually wounded, in a very positive way,

728
00:35:26,644 --> 00:35:31,517
Speaker 1: and to do the kind of work that I'm doing,

729
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:33,764
Speaker 1: that, that that wounding or that puncturing

730
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:36,611
Speaker 1: of the small self and it's and it's willing

731
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:39,458
Speaker 1: to, and the willingness in that context to

732
00:35:40,629 --> 00:35:42,176
Speaker 1: take second to the ego, to take second

733
00:35:42,196 --> 00:35:52,271
Speaker 1: place, willingly, happily, joyously, is

734
00:35:52,311 --> 00:35:53,914
Speaker 1: essential for spiritual work even to be

735
00:35:53,954 --> 00:35:56,098
Speaker 1: able to begin to spiritual work, to be able

736
00:35:56,118 --> 00:35:57,188
Speaker 1: to begin in earnest, because until that's

737
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:58,051
Speaker 1: happened, all the spiritual work to be able

738
00:35:58,071 --> 00:35:59,035
Speaker 1: to begin in earnest, because until that's

739
00:35:59,055 --> 00:36:01,686
Speaker 1: happened, all the spiritual work is just

740
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,725
Speaker 1: happening on the level of the intellect or

741
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,574
Speaker 1: the level of kind of performance.

742
00:36:09,465 --> 00:36:11,051
Speaker 1: You know, spiritual practice only happens

743
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:14,314
Speaker 1: once the ego has been punctured in a

744
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:16,206
Speaker 1: serious way and one has stopped resisting

745
00:36:16,406 --> 00:36:17,167
Speaker 1: the love of God.

746
00:36:30,798 --> 00:36:33,481
Speaker 1: Often I think about this question, about

747
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:34,181
Speaker 1: ego death.

748
00:36:34,201 --> 00:36:35,042
Speaker 1: What does it mean?

749
00:36:35,082 --> 00:36:35,702
Speaker 1: What does it look like?

750
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:48,650
Speaker 1: I often think about my own guru who was, as

751
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,632
Speaker 1: I described him, very powerfully awake,

752
00:36:49,652 --> 00:36:50,113
Speaker 1: powerfully enlightened.

753
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:51,035
Speaker 1: He also had a very strong sense of an ego,

754
00:36:51,055 --> 00:36:52,137
Speaker 1: a very strong self-sense.

755
00:36:58,301 --> 00:37:00,385
Speaker 1: He was a powerful man and the only way I

756
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:00,985
Speaker 1: can metaphorically describe to you what

757
00:37:00,945 --> 00:37:01,626
Speaker 1: that looks like is that, if you imagine,

758
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:09,632
Speaker 1: imagine the ego as this big shield for lack

759
00:37:09,652 --> 00:37:15,782
Speaker 1: of a better word this frontal shield, and

760
00:37:15,823 --> 00:37:19,230
Speaker 1: imagine, imagine if, as a result of a

761
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:25,671
Speaker 1: powerful awakening, a huge hole had been

762
00:37:25,691 --> 00:37:29,969
Speaker 1: made in the shield and through this hole,

763
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:33,286
Speaker 1: the light of the love of God, the love of

764
00:37:33,306 --> 00:37:37,666
Speaker 1: the absolute, the immensity and the

765
00:37:39,992 --> 00:37:43,119
Speaker 1: inconceivable glory and goodness of higher

766
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:46,935
Speaker 1: consciousness, the transcendental radiance,

767
00:37:47,996 --> 00:37:50,271
Speaker 1: will be shining through that huge hole.

768
00:37:53,434 --> 00:37:56,583
Speaker 1: The shield is still there, which is a

769
00:37:56,603 --> 00:37:58,363
Speaker 1: metaphor for the frontal self of the ego,

770
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,311
Speaker 1: ego personality, but it's been punctured,

771
00:38:03,351 --> 00:38:07,107
Speaker 1: it's been wounded, and in people whose

772
00:38:07,148 --> 00:38:13,156
Speaker 1: awakening is profound and enormous and

773
00:38:13,196 --> 00:38:16,241
Speaker 1: powerful and transformative.

774
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:18,522
Speaker 1: It means that there's a huge hole in their

775
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:22,441
Speaker 1: psyche, and transformative means that

776
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:24,185
Speaker 1: there's a huge hole in their psyche and

777
00:38:25,592 --> 00:38:26,415
Speaker 1: through that hole, the light of God, the

778
00:38:26,435 --> 00:38:29,314
Speaker 1: light of the absolute, the light of

779
00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:30,720
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness, shines through.

780
00:38:34,026 --> 00:38:36,848
Speaker 1: So the light and the radiance of God,

781
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,562
Speaker 1: consciousness, shines through their egos.

782
00:38:57,582 --> 00:38:58,963
Speaker 1: There's a couple of other things I wanted

783
00:38:58,983 --> 00:38:59,163
Speaker 1: to say.

784
00:38:59,585 --> 00:39:02,564
Speaker 1: I wanted to add to this picture is that

785
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:07,537
Speaker 1: there's many different ways to describe the

786
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,665
Speaker 1: ego and many different spiritual teachers

787
00:39:09,886 --> 00:39:12,752
Speaker 1: and spiritual gurus and psychotherapists

788
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:17,169
Speaker 1: and innovators of all kinds have their own

789
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,773
Speaker 1: theories about what these self-structures

790
00:39:20,853 --> 00:39:22,217
Speaker 1: look like and how they work.

791
00:39:25,286 --> 00:39:27,967
Speaker 1: So I have a very simple model, which is

792
00:39:28,007 --> 00:39:28,891
Speaker 1: just a simple model.

793
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:30,712
Speaker 1: The map is not the territory.

794
00:39:33,547 --> 00:39:34,831
Speaker 1: So I want to make clear the map is not the

795
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:35,293
Speaker 1: territory.

796
00:39:35,313 --> 00:39:36,591
Speaker 1: So what I'm saying, what I'm about to

797
00:39:36,612 --> 00:39:39,069
Speaker 1: describe to you about the ego, is just one

798
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:40,552
Speaker 1: helpful way to think about it, but it's not

799
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:41,414
Speaker 1: absolutely real.

800
00:39:41,474 --> 00:39:44,091
Speaker 1: Just to, you can use it as a tool to help

801
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,138
Speaker 1: you understand something that's very

802
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:46,004
Speaker 1: difficult to understand.

803
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:51,822
Speaker 1: But the ego is, uh, the organizing

804
00:39:51,842 --> 00:39:52,625
Speaker 1: principle in the psyche.

805
00:39:56,677 --> 00:39:58,221
Speaker 1: So we want the organizing principle in the

806
00:39:58,241 --> 00:39:59,726
Speaker 1: psyche to be in good shape, because if the

807
00:39:59,806 --> 00:40:01,190
Speaker 1: organizing principle in the psyche is in

808
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,736
Speaker 1: bad shape, you are going to be a mess.

809
00:40:07,432 --> 00:40:09,796
Speaker 1: It means yourself will be broken in many

810
00:40:09,816 --> 00:40:12,687
Speaker 1: different pieces and this is not a state or

811
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:14,895
Speaker 1: position or a state of consciousness or

812
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,851
Speaker 1: relationship to reality that any of us want

813
00:40:17,871 --> 00:40:20,056
Speaker 1: to be subject to.

814
00:40:20,136 --> 00:40:21,139
Speaker 1: That's a state of madness.

815
00:40:23,886 --> 00:40:25,592
Speaker 1: So the ego is a self-organizing principle

816
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:26,094
Speaker 1: in the psyche.

817
00:40:26,185 --> 00:40:27,491
Speaker 1: We want the ego to be in good shape.

818
00:40:29,446 --> 00:40:31,373
Speaker 1: We want the ego to be healthy and strong.

819
00:40:52,968 --> 00:40:54,859
Speaker 1: So what I call positive ego is when we have

820
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:55,723
Speaker 1: a positive relationship to our unique

821
00:40:55,743 --> 00:40:57,066
Speaker 1: self-identity, when we believe that we are

822
00:40:57,086 --> 00:40:59,209
Speaker 1: a good person At the level of the soul.

823
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:00,391
Speaker 1: We believe that we are inherently good

824
00:41:00,411 --> 00:41:01,112
Speaker 1: person, the level of the soul.

825
00:41:01,132 --> 00:41:02,034
Speaker 1: We believe that we are inherently good,

826
00:41:02,054 --> 00:41:03,917
Speaker 1: which means we are lovable, we're worth

827
00:41:03,977 --> 00:41:08,532
Speaker 1: loving, we are worthy of love, worthy of

828
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:13,640
Speaker 1: respect, worthy of the kindness and

829
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,202
Speaker 1: generosity of others.

830
00:41:14,925 --> 00:41:16,491
Speaker 1: We believe in our own inherent decency and

831
00:41:16,551 --> 00:41:19,936
Speaker 1: goodness and we also believe in our own

832
00:41:19,956 --> 00:41:20,782
Speaker 1: worthiness Very important also believe in

833
00:41:20,802 --> 00:41:21,566
Speaker 1: our own worthiness very important.

834
00:41:21,586 --> 00:41:24,945
Speaker 1: We believe in our own worthiness, which

835
00:41:24,965 --> 00:41:27,774
Speaker 1: means we have a measure of self-confidence

836
00:41:29,045 --> 00:41:31,533
Speaker 1: because we believe in ourselves at the

837
00:41:31,553 --> 00:41:32,275
Speaker 1: level of self.

838
00:41:39,636 --> 00:41:44,207
Speaker 1: It's a positive ego and a lot of

839
00:41:44,288 --> 00:41:45,707
Speaker 1: psychological work and also a lot of

840
00:41:45,727 --> 00:41:47,204
Speaker 1: spiritual work, to be honest, is really

841
00:41:47,245 --> 00:41:48,819
Speaker 1: about cultivating a positive ego.

842
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,841
Speaker 1: Sometimes we have to do a lot of

843
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:55,383
Speaker 1: psychological work and also a lot of

844
00:41:55,403 --> 00:41:59,221
Speaker 1: spiritual work to get to the point where we

845
00:41:59,261 --> 00:42:03,760
Speaker 1: can honestly say we respect ourselves, that

846
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:08,563
Speaker 1: where we love ourselves, small self, love

847
00:42:08,603 --> 00:42:11,864
Speaker 1: ourselves, respect ourselves and believe in

848
00:42:11,944 --> 00:42:12,667
Speaker 1: our own worthiness.

849
00:42:17,487 --> 00:42:19,292
Speaker 1: So the negative ego is a place of our

850
00:42:19,312 --> 00:42:22,966
Speaker 1: woundedness, a place of unresolved trauma,

851
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:32,081
Speaker 1: of fear and anger, resentment, rage and so

852
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:32,664
Speaker 1: much pain.

853
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:43,309
Speaker 1: Now, if we create bad karma and everybody

854
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:46,814
Speaker 1: does to some degree or other it's usually

855
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,241
Speaker 1: because of the ways we have been wounded

856
00:42:49,301 --> 00:42:53,165
Speaker 1: and traumatized and suffered is the result

857
00:42:53,205 --> 00:43:06,912
Speaker 1: of our woundedness, is usually the cause of

858
00:43:06,993 --> 00:43:08,560
Speaker 1: all of our self-destructive behavior.

859
00:43:12,499 --> 00:43:19,604
Speaker 1: And, as I was just saying, a lot of

860
00:43:19,624 --> 00:43:21,065
Speaker 1: psychological work and a lot of spiritual,

861
00:43:21,086 --> 00:43:22,216
Speaker 1: a lot of psychological work and a lot of

862
00:43:22,237 --> 00:43:22,580
Speaker 1: spiritual work.

863
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:28,433
Speaker 1: In the end, it's about healing these wounds

864
00:43:31,986 --> 00:43:36,274
Speaker 1: so that we can become self-respecting,

865
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,388
Speaker 1: powerfully kind, spiritually inspired,

866
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,187
Speaker 1: trustworthy it's an important one

867
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:46,608
Speaker 1: trustworthy, trustworthy, deeply

868
00:43:46,628 --> 00:43:50,360
Speaker 1: trustworthy, very deeply trustworthy

869
00:43:52,245 --> 00:43:54,131
Speaker 1: friends to ourselves and to other people.

870
00:43:56,122 --> 00:43:57,888
Speaker 1: Too many of us aren't really trustworthy in

871
00:43:57,908 --> 00:43:58,229
Speaker 1: the end.

872
00:44:04,374 --> 00:44:05,596
Speaker 1: Too many of us aren't really trustworthy in

873
00:44:05,636 --> 00:44:05,937
Speaker 1: the end.

874
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:08,708
Speaker 1: People who aren't trustworthy will always

875
00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:09,719
Speaker 1: end up betraying themselves and betraying

876
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:09,659
Speaker 1: you.

877
00:44:13,232 --> 00:44:24,797
Speaker 1: That's a result, and they do that because

878
00:44:24,817 --> 00:44:26,160
Speaker 1: they can't seem to help themselves not do

879
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:26,220
Speaker 1: it.

880
00:44:30,372 --> 00:44:31,375
Speaker 1: That's the negative ego.

881
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,875
Speaker 1: The negative ego needs work, and all of us.

882
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,160
Speaker 1: It needs work.

883
00:44:34,723 --> 00:44:36,548
Speaker 1: It needs whatever work, it needs to heal.

884
00:44:38,392 --> 00:44:45,012
Speaker 1: Now, as I said earlier in the call, in the

885
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:50,012
Speaker 1: psychological context, healing usually

886
00:44:50,052 --> 00:44:53,473
Speaker 1: comes as a result of coming to an

887
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:56,602
Speaker 1: understanding and experiential and

888
00:44:56,682 --> 00:44:58,148
Speaker 1: emotional experiential and also

889
00:44:58,848 --> 00:45:02,613
Speaker 1: intellectual understanding of what happened,

890
00:45:03,156 --> 00:45:04,722
Speaker 1: happened, what the causes were to the

891
00:45:04,762 --> 00:45:05,183
Speaker 1: problem.

892
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:10,075
Speaker 1: But the spiritual healing, as far as I

893
00:45:10,136 --> 00:45:11,820
Speaker 1: understand it and I experience it, is very

894
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,324
Speaker 1: different, as I already explained, is

895
00:45:13,344 --> 00:45:14,868
Speaker 1: because we've discovered something that is

896
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:18,404
Speaker 1: higher and deeper and more real and more

897
00:45:18,444 --> 00:45:21,051
Speaker 1: substantial than any psychological

898
00:45:21,111 --> 00:45:22,584
Speaker 1: experience, positive and negative could

899
00:45:22,604 --> 00:45:22,965
Speaker 1: ever be.

900
00:45:25,584 --> 00:45:28,592
Speaker 1: And in that context, it is our direct

901
00:45:28,632 --> 00:45:32,249
Speaker 1: cognizance of that which is higher and more

902
00:45:32,289 --> 00:45:36,766
Speaker 1: deeply real that freezes more and more from

903
00:45:36,786 --> 00:45:51,645
Speaker 1: the, from the negative tendencies and

904
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,677
Speaker 1: negative conditioning that come from the

905
00:45:54,697 --> 00:45:54,939
Speaker 1: negative ego.

906
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,924
Speaker 1: And the way I approach this, it's my belief,

907
00:46:01,564 --> 00:46:02,965
Speaker 1: it's my conviction, it's part of my

908
00:46:03,005 --> 00:46:05,227
Speaker 1: philosophy, my teaching philosophy is that

909
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:14,996
Speaker 1: I believe that the more we wake up, the

910
00:46:15,036 --> 00:46:34,856
Speaker 1: more sincerely we wake up, wake up, the

911
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:35,839
Speaker 1: more we have the courage to be authentic

912
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:36,200
Speaker 1: and transparent.

913
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:41,914
Speaker 1: And the more we have the courage to be

914
00:46:41,823 --> 00:46:43,371
Speaker 1: authentic and transparent and the more

915
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:43,645
Speaker 1: inspired by the higher states of

916
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:45,734
Speaker 1: consciousness, by the God consciousness, to

917
00:46:45,754 --> 00:46:50,847
Speaker 1: keep our dignity, because God consciousness,

918
00:46:50,887 --> 00:46:52,538
Speaker 1: or higher consciousness, or transcendental

919
00:46:52,578 --> 00:46:57,627
Speaker 1: awareness and awakening to non-duality, if

920
00:46:57,688 --> 00:46:59,424
Speaker 1: it's the real thing, will compel us to be

921
00:46:59,444 --> 00:47:00,269
Speaker 1: dignified and if it's the real thing, will

922
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:09,109
Speaker 1: compel us to be dignified to do the right

923
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:09,390
Speaker 1: thing.

924
00:47:11,902 --> 00:47:14,380
Speaker 1: Because inherent in the spiritual awakening

925
00:47:14,922 --> 00:47:17,666
Speaker 1: is the discovery of, and the presence of a

926
00:47:17,706 --> 00:47:27,629
Speaker 1: moral imperative which would compel us, if

927
00:47:27,649 --> 00:47:28,713
Speaker 1: you have the heart to hear it, to do a

928
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:30,018
Speaker 1: little better, to make a little bit more

929
00:47:30,099 --> 00:47:34,781
Speaker 1: effort, to care a little bit more, not to

930
00:47:34,801 --> 00:47:37,347
Speaker 1: fall apart, but to be a little bit more

931
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:41,561
Speaker 1: anti-fragile, a little bit more strong, so

932
00:47:41,602 --> 00:47:42,586
Speaker 1: we can fight the good fight.

933
00:47:46,565 --> 00:47:47,909
Speaker 1: I believe that's what we're all here for.

934
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,203
Speaker 1: After all, we've got to be here for a

935
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:49,625
Speaker 1: reason.

936
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,306
Speaker 1: I don't think life is a random accident and

937
00:47:54,366 --> 00:47:55,882
Speaker 1: I don't think I'm a random accident and I

938
00:47:55,902 --> 00:47:56,840
Speaker 1: don't think you're a random accident.

939
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,065
Speaker 1: I think we're all here for a very good

940
00:47:58,085 --> 00:47:58,386
Speaker 1: reason.

941
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:01,962
Speaker 1: But if we're here for a good reason and

942
00:48:01,982 --> 00:48:04,891
Speaker 1: from the perspective of God consciousness,

943
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,400
Speaker 1: that reason seems to be a reflection of the

944
00:48:08,461 --> 00:48:09,664
Speaker 1: energy and intelligence that created the

945
00:48:09,725 --> 00:48:12,805
Speaker 1: universe in and through the body, mind,

946
00:48:12,845 --> 00:48:15,648
Speaker 1: personality that God gave you gave all of

947
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:15,808
Speaker 1: us.

948
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,427
Speaker 1: So I think we all, when we awaken deeply

949
00:48:21,447 --> 00:48:27,217
Speaker 1: enough, we'll feel an obligation to become

950
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:28,820
Speaker 1: a reflection of our own highest potential,

951
00:48:31,514 --> 00:48:33,243
Speaker 1: not just for our own sake but for everyone

952
00:48:33,283 --> 00:48:37,519
Speaker 1: else's sake, because when you awaken deeply

953
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,562
Speaker 1: enough, you keep on realizing there's a

954
00:48:39,603 --> 00:48:43,127
Speaker 1: larger purpose to this whole process that

955
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:43,890
Speaker 1: we're in the midst of.

956
00:48:45,481 --> 00:48:49,471
Speaker 1: The human experience is not just an ego

957
00:48:49,492 --> 00:48:53,887
Speaker 1: trip Many people seem to think from their

958
00:48:53,907 --> 00:48:55,171
Speaker 1: behavior, seem to think that it is.

959
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,526
Speaker 1: The human experience is not, ladies and

960
00:48:57,546 --> 00:48:58,570
Speaker 1: gentlemen, just an ego trip.

961
00:49:02,544 --> 00:49:04,320
Speaker 1: It's a cosmic event that's unfolding

962
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,283
Speaker 1: throughout through us.

963
00:49:05,805 --> 00:49:09,444
Speaker 1: It's full of challenges, full of paradoxes

964
00:49:09,504 --> 00:49:11,249
Speaker 1: and difficult paradoxes and difficult

965
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:18,107
Speaker 1: contradictions, and full of pain and

966
00:49:18,128 --> 00:49:18,569
Speaker 1: suffering.

967
00:49:21,442 --> 00:49:22,861
Speaker 1: But if you awaken deeply enough, you see

968
00:49:22,881 --> 00:49:27,829
Speaker 1: there's a higher principle at work that

969
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:29,684
Speaker 1: makes it all worth it, no matter how tough

970
00:49:29,725 --> 00:49:31,226
Speaker 1: it is, no matter how tough it seems to be.

971
00:49:37,033 --> 00:49:40,409
Speaker 1: So one of the ways that I think about ego

972
00:49:40,449 --> 00:50:05,429
Speaker 1: death is that is that we become so moved by

973
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:08,846
Speaker 1: these transcendental truths as a result of

974
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:13,508
Speaker 1: being a deep experience with the personal

975
00:50:13,548 --> 00:50:15,012
Speaker 1: world, of the separate self-sense,

976
00:50:20,421 --> 00:50:21,585
Speaker 1: including all of the ways it's been

977
00:50:21,605 --> 00:50:25,850
Speaker 1: culturally conditioned by unenlightened

978
00:50:28,013 --> 00:50:34,678
Speaker 1: parents and teachers, has been

979
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:40,452
Speaker 1: fundamentally dislodged from the source of

980
00:50:40,492 --> 00:50:41,053
Speaker 1: our self-sense.

981
00:50:41,562 --> 00:50:42,144
Speaker 1: In other words.

982
00:50:42,405 --> 00:50:45,847
Speaker 1: There is this now, close to the source of

983
00:50:45,907 --> 00:50:46,589
Speaker 1: our self-sense.

984
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,355
Speaker 1: There is a vast open space of infinite

985
00:50:50,396 --> 00:50:53,021
Speaker 1: freedom and unimaginable potential that's

986
00:50:53,102 --> 00:50:56,625
Speaker 1: always available, and it's who and what God

987
00:50:56,685 --> 00:50:57,267
Speaker 1: actually is.

988
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:00,928
Speaker 1: Not what our ego tells us, not what other

989
00:51:00,968 --> 00:51:06,705
Speaker 1: peoples have told us, not all the terrible

990
00:51:06,745 --> 00:51:10,328
Speaker 1: things that happen to be true about human

991
00:51:10,368 --> 00:51:10,629
Speaker 1: life.

992
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:15,393
Speaker 1: We discover there's a deeper truth that

993
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:16,822
Speaker 1: transcends anything that happens in time

994
00:51:16,842 --> 00:51:20,564
Speaker 1: and space, and the more we have surrendered

995
00:51:20,445 --> 00:51:21,354
Speaker 1: to this deeper dimension space, and the

996
00:51:21,235 --> 00:51:22,623
Speaker 1: more we have surrendered to this deeper

997
00:51:22,643 --> 00:51:25,864
Speaker 1: dimension of reality, the more that

998
00:51:26,226 --> 00:51:28,205
Speaker 1: mysterious space will be present within us

999
00:51:29,801 --> 00:51:32,530
Speaker 1: that will always ensure our freedom and our

1000
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:36,280
Speaker 1: liberation, in spite of maybe being given a

1001
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:41,123
Speaker 1: very difficult deck of cards, in spite of

1002
00:51:41,143 --> 00:51:42,461
Speaker 1: the enormous challenges we're all gonna

1003
00:51:42,481 --> 00:51:43,365
Speaker 1: face on a human level.

1004
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,806
Speaker 1: There's something else that's become first

1005
00:51:45,846 --> 00:51:49,408
Speaker 1: and foremost in our attention, in our

1006
00:51:49,428 --> 00:51:50,771
Speaker 1: awareness, in our experience.

1007
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,687
Speaker 1: So we wanna see death of the ego more, as

1008
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,027
Speaker 1: when you meet people and you get to know

1009
00:52:00,067 --> 00:52:03,947
Speaker 1: them, especially if you get to know them,

1010
00:52:03,968 --> 00:52:04,877
Speaker 1: especially if you get to know them are they

1011
00:52:04,897 --> 00:52:07,409
Speaker 1: living for use mythic language.

1012
00:52:07,742 --> 00:52:10,038
Speaker 1: For some reason, I'm falling into that

1013
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:10,280
Speaker 1: habit.

1014
00:52:10,581 --> 00:52:12,932
Speaker 1: I'm not sure why I'm doing it, but the

1015
00:52:12,972 --> 00:52:13,840
Speaker 1: thing is, when you get to know people.

1016
00:52:14,683 --> 00:52:16,529
Speaker 1: Is this person living first and foremost

1017
00:52:16,549 --> 00:52:22,878
Speaker 1: for God or the absolute, the ultimate

1018
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:24,426
Speaker 1: mystery that lies between life and death?

1019
00:52:31,032 --> 00:52:32,862
Speaker 1: Is that what they're living for and is that

1020
00:52:32,882 --> 00:52:33,565
Speaker 1: what they're living from?

1021
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,329
Speaker 1: Are they trapped in the story of the small

1022
00:52:36,369 --> 00:52:42,445
Speaker 1: self, trapped in our collective story, or

1023
00:52:42,465 --> 00:52:43,988
Speaker 1: is some part of their persona and heart,

1024
00:52:44,008 --> 00:52:47,015
Speaker 1: small self, trapped in our collective story,

1025
00:52:47,075 --> 00:52:48,960
Speaker 1: or some part of their persona and heart

1026
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:51,863
Speaker 1: fundamentally liberated and vibrating with

1027
00:52:51,883 --> 00:52:53,388
Speaker 1: a deeper conviction about what's true?

1028
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,120
Speaker 1: So the death of the ego or the reduction of

1029
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,283
Speaker 1: its influence on our being can be seen if

1030
00:53:03,303 --> 00:53:04,924
Speaker 1: you, if it depends on you, you know you can

1031
00:53:04,964 --> 00:53:07,406
Speaker 1: only, you can only see and understand as

1032
00:53:07,467 --> 00:53:09,408
Speaker 1: much, as much as you can have experienced

1033
00:53:09,428 --> 00:53:09,889
Speaker 1: yourself.

1034
00:53:15,994 --> 00:53:25,125
Speaker 1: But if your soul has been, if a soul, sorry,

1035
00:53:25,406 --> 00:53:26,649
Speaker 1: if a hole has been punctured in your soul

1036
00:53:26,709 --> 00:53:28,293
Speaker 1: and that hole is to God of the absolute,

1037
00:53:30,781 --> 00:53:31,845
Speaker 1: you're going to know and it's all.

1038
00:53:31,865 --> 00:53:41,666
Speaker 1: Everyone else Doesn't mean your ego's gone,

1039
00:53:43,933 --> 00:53:45,182
Speaker 1: doesn't mean it's not going to continue to

1040
00:53:45,203 --> 00:53:46,942
Speaker 1: make great problems for you either, and

1041
00:53:46,982 --> 00:53:47,706
Speaker 1: other people also.

1042
00:53:50,073 --> 00:53:52,605
Speaker 1: The ego doesn't let go very easily, as we

1043
00:53:52,665 --> 00:53:52,987
Speaker 1: all know.

1044
00:53:54,934 --> 00:53:56,493
Speaker 1: I used to call the ego the irrational

1045
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:59,249
Speaker 1: refusal, the irrational refusenik.

1046
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,545
Speaker 1: It's the part of us that says no, I won't.

1047
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:02,171
Speaker 1: Irrational refusal, the irrational

1048
00:54:02,212 --> 00:54:06,110
Speaker 1: refusenik, it's the part of us that says no,

1049
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:09,592
Speaker 1: I won't, even though we know we should.

1050
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:11,863
Speaker 1: We know we should, but we say I won't.

1051
00:54:11,883 --> 00:54:12,865
Speaker 1: You say, well, what's the matter?

1052
00:54:12,885 --> 00:54:13,186
Speaker 1: Why not?

1053
00:54:13,206 --> 00:54:14,208
Speaker 1: You say because I don't want to.

1054
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:15,532
Speaker 1: Why?

1055
00:54:19,413 --> 00:54:20,579
Speaker 1: Because I don't.

1056
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:24,426
Speaker 1: So the ego, from the perspective of

1057
00:54:24,446 --> 00:54:25,630
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness, can be seen as the

1058
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:28,580
Speaker 1: irrational refusenik or the irrational no.

1059
00:54:30,561 --> 00:54:35,424
Speaker 1: And so it's getting you, getting me or you,

1060
00:54:35,484 --> 00:54:38,723
Speaker 1: whoever you are, whoever I am, to say yes

1061
00:54:39,646 --> 00:54:41,244
Speaker 1: in spite of that and that's a very

1062
00:54:41,324 --> 00:54:45,365
Speaker 1: difficult thing to do In spite of the no of

1063
00:54:45,385 --> 00:54:51,889
Speaker 1: the ego remaining in the unconditional yes,

1064
00:54:54,262 --> 00:54:55,467
Speaker 1: and that's what I call ego death.

1065
00:55:07,061 --> 00:55:09,585
Speaker 1: And everything that I'm describing to you

1066
00:55:09,605 --> 00:55:09,826
Speaker 1: can be done.

1067
00:55:09,846 --> 00:55:10,968
Speaker 1: It's not, um, it's not out of it's not out

1068
00:55:10,988 --> 00:55:14,053
Speaker 1: of most people's reach, even though most

1069
00:55:14,073 --> 00:55:18,082
Speaker 1: people don't do it, because it's just more

1070
00:55:18,122 --> 00:55:18,982
Speaker 1: than most people want.

1071
00:55:19,063 --> 00:55:20,403
Speaker 1: Most people don't want to go that deep.

1072
00:55:42,537 --> 00:55:43,838
Speaker 1: Very good, I have more to say on this

1073
00:55:45,164 --> 00:55:46,628
Speaker 1: mysterious subject, but I think I'll leave

1074
00:55:46,668 --> 00:55:47,310
Speaker 1: it at that for now.

1075
00:55:56,281 --> 00:55:57,364
Speaker 1: I just want to end saying that

1076
00:55:57,404 --> 00:55:59,410
Speaker 1: enlightenment is real, that it exists, that

1077
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:03,183
Speaker 1: it's attainable please don't doubt it

1078
00:56:03,203 --> 00:56:04,204
Speaker 1: exists, that it's attainable, please don't

1079
00:56:04,224 --> 00:56:08,007
Speaker 1: doubt it and also that the most important

1080
00:56:08,047 --> 00:56:09,689
Speaker 1: thing, if you're sincere and serious about

1081
00:56:09,729 --> 00:56:13,192
Speaker 1: this is not that the ego is eradicated

1082
00:56:13,932 --> 00:56:15,674
Speaker 1: completely, totally and unconditionally,

1083
00:56:15,694 --> 00:56:16,995
Speaker 1: because that's probably not going to happen

1084
00:56:17,936 --> 00:56:19,217
Speaker 1: and, most importantly, it doesn't need to

1085
00:56:19,237 --> 00:56:25,466
Speaker 1: happen but the ego has to bow down and has

1086
00:56:25,486 --> 00:56:27,031
Speaker 1: to be willing to become the second fiddle

1087
00:56:27,743 --> 00:56:30,484
Speaker 1: in the story of your life, not my life,

1088
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:30,946
Speaker 1: your life.

1089
00:56:37,501 --> 00:56:38,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was one more thing I wanted to

1090
00:56:38,886 --> 00:56:42,908
Speaker 1: mention, which I will, which is for our

1091
00:56:42,968 --> 00:56:43,390
Speaker 1: pride.

1092
00:56:43,761 --> 00:56:45,428
Speaker 1: This is just positive pride and negative

1093
00:56:45,448 --> 00:56:45,709
Speaker 1: pride.

1094
00:56:47,064 --> 00:56:48,609
Speaker 1: Positive pride is self respect.

1095
00:56:48,629 --> 00:56:52,088
Speaker 1: It's all good, but the negative pride is

1096
00:56:52,148 --> 00:56:55,007
Speaker 1: the part of your ego, the ego, our ego,

1097
00:56:56,505 --> 00:56:58,150
Speaker 1: that would rather die than bow down.

1098
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,404
Speaker 1: That's the biggest obstacle to the

1099
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:03,015
Speaker 1: awakening to enlightened awareness that

1100
00:57:03,035 --> 00:57:04,660
Speaker 1: would rather die than bow down.

1101
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,542
Speaker 1: That's the biggest obstacle to the

1102
00:57:05,563 --> 00:57:06,305
Speaker 1: awakening to enlightened awareness.

1103
00:57:06,325 --> 00:57:11,527
Speaker 1: Is the vicious pride that we feel as this

1104
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:15,545
Speaker 1: ferocious reluctance to bow down, to give

1105
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:19,288
Speaker 1: in, to say, not my will, but thy will be

1106
00:57:19,328 --> 00:57:19,549
Speaker 1: done.

1107
00:57:20,662 --> 00:57:24,449
Speaker 1: So it's the irrational refusal to bow down,

1108
00:57:26,226 --> 00:57:27,169
Speaker 1: become second fiddle.

1109
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:30,619
Speaker 1: It's the most difficult expression of ego.

1110
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:34,537
Speaker 1: For those who are most serious about this,

1111
00:57:34,637 --> 00:57:35,120
Speaker 1: it's pride.

1112
00:57:36,813 --> 00:57:42,854
Speaker 1: So be aware of pride, be very aware of

1113
00:57:43,015 --> 00:57:45,189
Speaker 1: pride, be very aware of your pride.

1114
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,720
Speaker 1: Positive pride is good, it's self-respect.

1115
00:57:50,927 --> 00:57:56,029
Speaker 1: The pride of the ego, the arrogant pride,

1116
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:56,920
Speaker 1: is very dangerous and can be a big problem

1117
00:57:58,285 --> 00:58:04,421
Speaker 1: for those who want to be free, but nothing

1118
00:58:04,461 --> 00:58:06,407
Speaker 1: that I have spoken about so far is

1119
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:07,169
Speaker 1: unattainable.

1120
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,363
Speaker 1: It's all within your grasp if you want it.

1121
00:58:11,403 --> 00:58:12,044
Speaker 1: Badly enough you.
