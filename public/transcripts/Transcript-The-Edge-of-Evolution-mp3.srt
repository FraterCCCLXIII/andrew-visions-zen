1
00:00:01,224 --> 00:00:03,109
Speaker 1: So tonight, at least where I am, it's

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:03,611
Speaker 1: evening.

3
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:06,906
Speaker 1: I want to speak about what it means to live

4
00:00:06,946 --> 00:00:09,063
Speaker 1: on the edge of evolution, on the very edge

5
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:12,741
Speaker 1: of the creative impulse, and, very

6
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:17,850
Speaker 1: specifically, I want to try and articulate,

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:27,323
Speaker 1: explicate, define, define, give all of you

8
00:00:27,343 --> 00:00:30,710
Speaker 1: a sense, an idea, a feeling of what a truly

9
00:00:32,153 --> 00:00:36,626
Speaker 1: liberated, inherently creative,

10
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:39,661
Speaker 1: evolutionary-inspired relationship to the

11
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:41,007
Speaker 1: human experience actually is.

12
00:00:42,682 --> 00:00:45,221
Speaker 1: This is what I want to try and do, but at

13
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:47,922
Speaker 1: the very beginning of the presentation I

14
00:00:47,962 --> 00:00:50,607
Speaker 1: wanted to make clear, as I often do, that

15
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:56,645
Speaker 1: the context in which I teach and all the

16
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:58,348
Speaker 1: points I'm trying to make about life and

17
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,691
Speaker 1: about reality and about the human

18
00:00:59,732 --> 00:01:05,268
Speaker 1: experience are all from the perspective of

19
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:09,554
Speaker 1: awakened consciousness or enlightened

20
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:12,969
Speaker 1: awareness, as I experience it and as I

21
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:13,611
Speaker 1: understand it.

22
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:19,803
Speaker 1: So it's a unique vantage point, it's a very

23
00:01:19,883 --> 00:01:21,808
Speaker 1: particular way of seeing reality,

24
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,844
Speaker 1: understanding reality and relating to

25
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:25,367
Speaker 1: reality.

26
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:29,106
Speaker 1: But I want to make clear it is not the only

27
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:31,752
Speaker 1: way to see reality, it's not the only way

28
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:34,531
Speaker 1: to understand reality and it's not the only

29
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:35,796
Speaker 1: way to make sense out of reality.

30
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:41,248
Speaker 1: But it's an important one and what makes

31
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,811
Speaker 1: what I'm defining as the enlightened

32
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:44,314
Speaker 1: perspective or the enlightened vantage

33
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:48,502
Speaker 1: point uniquely profound and uniquely

34
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,891
Speaker 1: significant as we try and come to terms

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,305
Speaker 1: with what it means to be human, what it

36
00:01:53,325 --> 00:01:54,189
Speaker 1: means to be conscious.

37
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,109
Speaker 1: What it means to be conscious is.

38
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:04,770
Speaker 1: This is because when we, when we awaken to

39
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,863
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness, when our

40
00:02:07,904 --> 00:02:12,465
Speaker 1: consciousness expands in the enlightenment

41
00:02:12,486 --> 00:02:15,974
Speaker 1: context, there's a shift in our experience

42
00:02:16,014 --> 00:02:18,624
Speaker 1: of consciousness and cognition from what

43
00:02:18,664 --> 00:02:20,368
Speaker 1: could be called a relative perspective,

44
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,941
Speaker 1: relative understanding, relative

45
00:02:23,982 --> 00:02:27,281
Speaker 1: consciousness and relative cognition to

46
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:28,827
Speaker 1: absolute consciousness and absolute

47
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:29,329
Speaker 1: cognition.

48
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:33,545
Speaker 1: So it's hard to understand what the

49
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:34,849
Speaker 1: difference between relative and absolute

50
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,966
Speaker 1: actually means, outside of having the

51
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:39,671
Speaker 1: actual experience of what it means.

52
00:02:41,302 --> 00:02:48,232
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it tends to become way too

53
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:50,056
Speaker 1: intellectually abstract a distinction.

54
00:02:50,096 --> 00:02:52,363
Speaker 1: But we've got to work with where we are.

55
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:54,087
Speaker 1: So everybody do the best they can.

56
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:04,566
Speaker 1: But I just I want to say that when we yes,

57
00:03:04,787 --> 00:03:15,925
Speaker 1: I'd like a two that when we, when we

58
00:03:15,965 --> 00:03:20,428
Speaker 1: consciously choose to embrace the unique

59
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:22,092
Speaker 1: perspective that becomes available to us

60
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,791
Speaker 1: when we awaken to enlightened awareness,

61
00:03:23,092 --> 00:03:23,794
Speaker 1: the unique perspective that becomes

62
00:03:23,815 --> 00:03:24,557
Speaker 1: available to us when we awaken to

63
00:03:24,577 --> 00:03:27,163
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness, we are choosing to

64
00:03:27,244 --> 00:03:30,312
Speaker 1: embrace a non-relative or absolute position

65
00:03:31,063 --> 00:03:32,448
Speaker 1: in relationship to being human.

66
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:36,809
Speaker 1: And if we choose to take an absolute

67
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,666
Speaker 1: position in relationship to the challenge

68
00:03:38,726 --> 00:03:39,982
Speaker 1: of being human, it's important that we

69
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,390
Speaker 1: clearly understand that we're doing that

70
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,223
Speaker 1: and we clearly understand that we're doing

71
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:49,851
Speaker 1: that and we clearly understand that this

72
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:51,935
Speaker 1: absolute vantage point, this absolute

73
00:03:51,975 --> 00:03:53,685
Speaker 1: perspective, this absolute position is

74
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:55,509
Speaker 1: realizable.

75
00:03:56,766 --> 00:04:00,628
Speaker 1: It's realizable and it's possible to have

76
00:04:00,648 --> 00:04:06,288
Speaker 1: an experience of what that means, but as a

77
00:04:06,388 --> 00:04:11,384
Speaker 1: human being it's impossible to reach it or

78
00:04:11,404 --> 00:04:11,906
Speaker 1: to equal it.

79
00:04:11,926 --> 00:04:15,248
Speaker 1: This is the absolute position, the absolute

80
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:19,450
Speaker 1: vantage point which enters into our

81
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,607
Speaker 1: awareness and our understanding in higher

82
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:23,860
Speaker 1: states of consciousness, when we transcend

83
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,368
Speaker 1: the ego and the small self, reveals to us a

84
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:29,878
Speaker 1: non-relative or absolute dimension of

85
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,893
Speaker 1: reality which is definitely higher and

86
00:04:34,913 --> 00:04:41,277
Speaker 1: inherently free and liberated in ways that

87
00:04:41,337 --> 00:04:43,142
Speaker 1: relative reality, relative consciousness,

88
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:45,067
Speaker 1: relative cognition, relative experience

89
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,132
Speaker 1: never is and never will be.

90
00:04:49,484 --> 00:04:53,062
Speaker 1: So as I describe this non-relative or

91
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:55,056
Speaker 1: absolute vantage point from the perspective

92
00:04:55,741 --> 00:04:58,485
Speaker 1: of the evolutionary impulse, I want you all

93
00:04:58,525 --> 00:05:02,341
Speaker 1: to understand that I'm describing a

94
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:04,208
Speaker 1: possibility and a potential that is

95
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:07,490
Speaker 1: ultimately unattainable.

96
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:12,046
Speaker 1: And a big part of the teaching of

97
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:14,670
Speaker 1: evolutionary enlightenment which is what I

98
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,481
Speaker 1: teach, is a big theme in this teaching is

99
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:21,977
Speaker 1: to reach beyond ordinary boundaries as we

100
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:23,727
Speaker 1: strive to evolve and strive to become more

101
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:24,614
Speaker 1: conscious and strive to actual more

102
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:25,941
Speaker 1: conscious and strive to actualize and

103
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:29,028
Speaker 1: realize and liberate all the inherent

104
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:31,093
Speaker 1: creative potentials that exist within us.

105
00:05:32,663 --> 00:05:34,348
Speaker 1: But it becomes apparent pretty soon that

106
00:05:34,388 --> 00:05:36,072
Speaker 1: unless we all are willing to make the

107
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:42,128
Speaker 1: heroic spiritual effort to liberate these

108
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,433
Speaker 1: extraordinary potentials within us that

109
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:46,735
Speaker 1: we're never going to do it.

110
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,150
Speaker 1: And so I found that, while we reach for

111
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:55,933
Speaker 1: what I'm defining as being absolute in this

112
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:59,085
Speaker 1: creative context, we're reaching for a

113
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,369
Speaker 1: possibility we're never going to be able to

114
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:03,506
Speaker 1: fully attain as long as we're in this human

115
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,652
Speaker 1: body and mind, in this human frame.

116
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:09,729
Speaker 1: It's in it, through the reaching, that new

117
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:11,373
Speaker 1: and extraordinary potentials and powers and

118
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,708
Speaker 1: possibilities begin to reveal themselves

119
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,752
Speaker 1: and manifest themselves.

120
00:06:16,057 --> 00:06:17,441
Speaker 1: And they manifest themselves only because

121
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,363
Speaker 1: we were reaching beyond ordinary boundaries,

122
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:22,067
Speaker 1: which most people don't like to do or not

123
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:23,028
Speaker 1: in the habit of doing.

124
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:33,009
Speaker 1: The evolutionary relationship to

125
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,140
Speaker 1: enlightenment is very goal-oriented.

126
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:39,000
Speaker 1: It's actually about liberating capacities

127
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:43,057
Speaker 1: of consciousness, cognition and ways of

128
00:06:43,077 --> 00:06:45,848
Speaker 1: seeing reality that we need to reach for

129
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,286
Speaker 1: that they won't just reveal themselves to

130
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,047
Speaker 1: us of their own accord.

131
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:53,590
Speaker 1: We have to be interested in cracking the

132
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,323
Speaker 1: atom, so to speak, of our own ignorance in

133
00:06:56,343 --> 00:06:58,209
Speaker 1: the context of an evolutionarily inspired

134
00:06:58,249 --> 00:06:58,771
Speaker 1: enlightenment.

135
00:07:01,122 --> 00:07:03,102
Speaker 1: It was in the reaching, when we stretch

136
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:07,166
Speaker 1: beyond the normal boundaries, when we break

137
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:09,605
Speaker 1: the boundaries of our own multidimensional

138
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:13,164
Speaker 1: levels of inertia, refusal, resistance,

139
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:14,669
Speaker 1: ignorance, arrogance, stupidity,

140
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,302
Speaker 1: selfishness and narcissism, that

141
00:07:18,322 --> 00:07:19,756
Speaker 1: extraordinary things begin to reveal

142
00:07:19,796 --> 00:07:21,404
Speaker 1: themselves and become apparent to us that

143
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:31,909
Speaker 1: we just had no idea existed so, and become

144
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:32,891
Speaker 1: apparent to us that we just had no idea

145
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:33,071
Speaker 1: existed.

146
00:07:33,091 --> 00:07:34,574
Speaker 1: So this non-relative or absolute dimension

147
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:42,794
Speaker 1: of reality reveals to us miraculous

148
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:46,326
Speaker 1: potentials, and that's what I want to talk

149
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:50,622
Speaker 1: about Now.

150
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:56,683
Speaker 1: To continue along these lines, the paradox

151
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,227
Speaker 1: of enlightenment has to do with the fact

152
00:07:58,248 --> 00:08:02,867
Speaker 1: that we're all mortal human beings, so we

153
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:05,118
Speaker 1: are physically mortal and frail and

154
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:05,540
Speaker 1: vulnerable.

155
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:08,329
Speaker 1: We are emotionally, psychologically,

156
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:10,860
Speaker 1: mortally frail and vulnerable.

157
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:14,709
Speaker 1: We're all imperfect and we're never going

158
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,292
Speaker 1: to be able to get anywhere near being

159
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:19,353
Speaker 1: perfect expressions and manifestations of

160
00:08:19,394 --> 00:08:21,223
Speaker 1: the human potential, because it's never

161
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:21,786
Speaker 1: happened before.

162
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:28,392
Speaker 1: Perfection exists as an ideal that exists

163
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:32,063
Speaker 1: somewhere in the distant future and, as

164
00:08:32,124 --> 00:08:34,095
Speaker 1: I've been saying, if we continue to reach

165
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:38,325
Speaker 1: for perfection, we can realize moments of

166
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:45,454
Speaker 1: grace and give rise to possibilities that

167
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:48,625
Speaker 1: are truly miraculous but are not yet truly

168
00:08:48,686 --> 00:08:49,067
Speaker 1: perfect.

169
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:59,347
Speaker 1: So in this enlightenment process, we are

170
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:00,611
Speaker 1: trying to straddle two boats.

171
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:04,145
Speaker 1: One of those boats exists in the

172
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:05,568
Speaker 1: non-relative or absolute dimension of

173
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:08,245
Speaker 1: reality and the other boat exists in the

174
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:12,708
Speaker 1: relative dimension of reality.

175
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:15,434
Speaker 1: And we want to.

176
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,166
Speaker 1: What we want to do through spiritual

177
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:19,026
Speaker 1: practice and inquiring and investigation

178
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:21,406
Speaker 1: and commitment, we want to learn how to

179
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:24,544
Speaker 1: balance these relative and absolute

180
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,329
Speaker 1: dimensions of reality and learn how to

181
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:26,535
Speaker 1: balance these relative and absolute

182
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:28,622
Speaker 1: dimensions of reality and learn how to

183
00:09:28,662 --> 00:09:33,071
Speaker 1: balance them exquisitely, elegantly,

184
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:34,314
Speaker 1: beautifully.

185
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:42,935
Speaker 1: Some people go too far in either direction

186
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:44,547
Speaker 1: and make a terrible mistake as they leave

187
00:09:44,608 --> 00:09:45,380
Speaker 1: out one side of the picture.

188
00:09:49,565 --> 00:09:53,169
Speaker 1: So some realizers in the enlightenment

189
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:57,154
Speaker 1: traditions, when they awaken, they will

190
00:09:57,194 --> 00:10:00,783
Speaker 1: claim that only the absolute is real and

191
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:03,334
Speaker 1: everything relative, gross and subtle is

192
00:10:03,374 --> 00:10:04,620
Speaker 1: all part of that which is unreal.

193
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:07,853
Speaker 1: And everything relative, gross and subtle

194
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:09,359
Speaker 1: is all part of that which is unreal.

195
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:17,147
Speaker 1: And so in those traditions, using that kind

196
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:18,509
Speaker 1: of contextual framework, a significant part

197
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:20,312
Speaker 1: of the experience of being human, which

198
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:23,375
Speaker 1: exists in relative reality, is somehow

199
00:10:23,395 --> 00:10:26,056
Speaker 1: being avoided and denied and not honestly

200
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:28,718
Speaker 1: and truthfully being fully embraced and

201
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:29,378
Speaker 1: responded to.

202
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:30,944
Speaker 1: I believe I don't think I'm the only one

203
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:31,627
Speaker 1: who sees it that way.

204
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,460
Speaker 1: And that's one side of the spectrum.

205
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,226
Speaker 1: On the other side of the spectrum there's

206
00:10:37,246 --> 00:10:40,512
Speaker 1: people who deny that any kind of absolute

207
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:42,261
Speaker 1: or non-relative dimension of reality or

208
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:43,948
Speaker 1: consciousness actually exists.

209
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,530
Speaker 1: And people speaking from such a vantage

210
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,298
Speaker 1: point would say that that which is purely

211
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:53,348
Speaker 1: relative is all there is.

212
00:10:54,972 --> 00:11:00,385
Speaker 1: Tragically so, to use mythic language, they

213
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:04,131
Speaker 1: would proclaim that Gagas really exists, or

214
00:11:04,752 --> 00:11:06,094
Speaker 1: there's no such thing as an absolute

215
00:11:06,134 --> 00:11:08,582
Speaker 1: principle that exists, the discovery which

216
00:11:08,622 --> 00:11:10,126
Speaker 1: changes everything and becomes the source

217
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:10,828
Speaker 1: of our liberation.

218
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,011
Speaker 1: They would deny it.

219
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:15,808
Speaker 1: They say it's all a realm of fantasy and

220
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:18,064
Speaker 1: imagination, religious and spiritual

221
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:19,168
Speaker 1: fantasy and imagination.

222
00:11:21,842 --> 00:11:24,268
Speaker 1: So what I try and do is I try and do the

223
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:29,400
Speaker 1: best I can to make clear to everybody, as

224
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:31,525
Speaker 1: my teacher made clear to me, that relative

225
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,653
Speaker 1: and absolute are two sides of one coin.

226
00:11:37,502 --> 00:11:39,387
Speaker 1: They're two parts of a whole picture of

227
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:41,672
Speaker 1: reality and have a whole experience of

228
00:11:41,712 --> 00:11:42,173
Speaker 1: reality.

229
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:46,247
Speaker 1: Relative and absolute are one and not two.

230
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:55,861
Speaker 1: And the more we understand this, the more

231
00:11:55,881 --> 00:12:00,037
Speaker 1: we make it possible for our experience of

232
00:12:00,077 --> 00:12:04,085
Speaker 1: relative reality to inform our experience

233
00:12:04,105 --> 00:12:05,768
Speaker 1: and understanding of absolute reality.

234
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,775
Speaker 1: And the same way, we want to learn how to

235
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,327
Speaker 1: have our experience of enlightened

236
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:15,963
Speaker 1: awareness of absolute reality inform our

237
00:12:15,983 --> 00:12:18,851
Speaker 1: experience of relative reality, challenging

238
00:12:19,221 --> 00:12:22,450
Speaker 1: the challenge of being fully human in a

239
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,003
Speaker 1: difficult and challenging world.

240
00:12:30,724 --> 00:12:36,453
Speaker 1: So that's kind of the big picture.

241
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:37,754
Speaker 1: Now, in my teaching of evolutionary

242
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:42,262
Speaker 1: enlightenment for many years I've made this

243
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:43,469
Speaker 1: distinction between what I have chosen to

244
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:45,178
Speaker 1: call the old enlightenment and the new

245
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,290
Speaker 1: enlightenment, the old enlightenment, or

246
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:46,576
Speaker 1: what I'm choosing to call the old

247
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:47,104
Speaker 1: enlightenment and the new enlightenment.

248
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:47,775
Speaker 1: The old enlightenment, or I'm choosing to

249
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:49,805
Speaker 1: call the old enlightenment, is the being

250
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:50,347
Speaker 1: enlightenment.

251
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:54,869
Speaker 1: It's what the great Eckhart Tolle teaches

252
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:55,491
Speaker 1: so beautifully.

253
00:12:57,981 --> 00:12:59,748
Speaker 1: It's what the Buddha was pointing to.

254
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,426
Speaker 1: It's the awakening to that which is

255
00:13:02,487 --> 00:13:03,963
Speaker 1: changeless, timeless, formless,

256
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:05,950
Speaker 1: beginningless and endless and eternal.

257
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,928
Speaker 1: It's about the awakening to what the Buddha

258
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:12,552
Speaker 1: called the deathless, the uncreated and the

259
00:13:12,632 --> 00:13:15,825
Speaker 1: unborn, what Ramana Maharshi called the

260
00:13:15,865 --> 00:13:19,543
Speaker 1: self, what Mahayana Buddha self referred to

261
00:13:19,703 --> 00:13:24,091
Speaker 1: as the deepest dimension of reality, is

262
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:26,775
Speaker 1: voidness, emptiness or nothingness.

263
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:32,675
Speaker 1: So in the traditional, what I call the old

264
00:13:32,716 --> 00:13:36,043
Speaker 1: enlightenment, as we aspire to awaken to

265
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:39,266
Speaker 1: the enlightenment of the Buddha, of Ramana

266
00:13:39,306 --> 00:13:45,042
Speaker 1: Maharshi, the goal in that context is

267
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:46,614
Speaker 1: usually the goal in that context is usually

268
00:13:46,654 --> 00:13:51,503
Speaker 1: the goal of freedom, inner freedom of a

269
00:13:51,563 --> 00:14:01,498
Speaker 1: radical, uncompromised, profound, almost

270
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:02,702
Speaker 1: inconceivable experience, of almost

271
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:12,214
Speaker 1: inconceivable experience of liberation.

272
00:14:15,102 --> 00:14:16,848
Speaker 1: And the experience of timeless, formless,

273
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:18,262
Speaker 1: beginningless and endless, eternal

274
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:21,651
Speaker 1: liberation is definitely not nothing, it's

275
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:22,753
Speaker 1: definitely something.

276
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:27,739
Speaker 1: It's definitely not nothing, it's

277
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,599
Speaker 1: definitely something.

278
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,043
Speaker 1: We don't want to underestimate the

279
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:30,866
Speaker 1: significance and the profundity of the

280
00:14:30,927 --> 00:14:32,633
Speaker 1: experience of inner liberation.

281
00:14:33,922 --> 00:14:35,828
Speaker 1: So the experience of inner liberation of

282
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:43,247
Speaker 1: samadhi, of satori, of nirvana, if you're

283
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:46,646
Speaker 1: lucky enough to glimpse it, you'll know

284
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,321
Speaker 1: that you'll suddenly understand what the

285
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:50,722
Speaker 1: Buddha was talking about, you'll suddenly

286
00:14:50,742 --> 00:14:52,348
Speaker 1: understand what Ramana Maharshi was talking

287
00:14:52,388 --> 00:14:52,549
Speaker 1: about.

288
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,701
Speaker 1: It will suddenly all make sense to you and

289
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:55,981
Speaker 1: it'll never make sense to you unless you

290
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,126
Speaker 1: actually have the experience.

291
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,713
Speaker 1: But the experience is of a primordial.

292
00:15:05,143 --> 00:15:08,265
Speaker 1: It's the discovery of a primordial state of

293
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:11,008
Speaker 1: being where liberation is all there is.

294
00:15:12,164 --> 00:15:12,967
Speaker 1: There's only freedom.

295
00:15:16,568 --> 00:15:17,531
Speaker 1: And in that miraculous state of

296
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:20,054
Speaker 1: consciousness you find that that miraculous

297
00:15:20,075 --> 00:15:23,537
Speaker 1: state of freedom not only is your

298
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:25,806
Speaker 1: birthright but has been available and

299
00:15:25,846 --> 00:15:27,331
Speaker 1: present to you from the very beginning.

300
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,766
Speaker 1: You just didn't see it, you weren't aware

301
00:15:28,786 --> 00:15:30,746
Speaker 1: of it because your attention was on other

302
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:31,108
Speaker 1: things.

303
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:36,629
Speaker 1: But in this miraculous state of inner

304
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:40,764
Speaker 1: freedom, the essence of it is.

305
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:45,269
Speaker 1: The essence of it reveals itself to us when

306
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:48,103
Speaker 1: we let go of everything else.

307
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:52,420
Speaker 1: So the metaphor that I often use for

308
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,946
Speaker 1: letting go of everything, letting go of

309
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,925
Speaker 1: everything else, is having nothing, knowing

310
00:15:56,965 --> 00:16:00,041
Speaker 1: nothing and being no one, zero emptiness.

311
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:12,092
Speaker 1: So in Buddhism they tell us that the

312
00:16:12,153 --> 00:16:14,304
Speaker 1: experience of profound liberation is

313
00:16:14,324 --> 00:16:18,109
Speaker 1: freedom from attachment and freedom from

314
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:18,550
Speaker 1: desire.

315
00:16:19,683 --> 00:16:21,710
Speaker 1: Having nothing, knowing nothing and being

316
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,400
Speaker 1: no one is liberation.

317
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,287
Speaker 1: Having nothing, knowing nothing and being

318
00:16:25,307 --> 00:16:25,831
Speaker 1: no one is is liberation.

319
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:26,879
Speaker 1: Having nothing, knowing nothing, being no

320
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:28,406
Speaker 1: one, is unconditional, radical and profound

321
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:32,250
Speaker 1: liberation from attachment and longing.

322
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,486
Speaker 1: Having nothing, knowing nothing, being no

323
00:16:35,586 --> 00:16:35,646
Speaker 1: one.

324
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,409
Speaker 1: So the goal in this, what I call the all

325
00:16:39,469 --> 00:16:43,069
Speaker 1: enlightenment, is to, at the level of our

326
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:47,096
Speaker 1: souls, the level of the soul to have let go

327
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:58,250
Speaker 1: so deeply that there is an inner access to

328
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:03,050
Speaker 1: a state of infinite freedom, where there is

329
00:17:04,726 --> 00:17:09,712
Speaker 1: a nothing that is synonymous with eternity.

330
00:17:12,341 --> 00:17:13,967
Speaker 1: And in that nothing that is synonymous with

331
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:16,647
Speaker 1: eternity there seems to be no such thing as

332
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:21,746
Speaker 1: birth, no such thing as death, no such

333
00:17:21,786 --> 00:17:23,331
Speaker 1: thing as here, no such thing as there.

334
00:17:25,081 --> 00:17:28,709
Speaker 1: But the idea is, in this kind of primordial,

335
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:33,584
Speaker 1: traditional enlightenment, the fundamental

336
00:17:33,624 --> 00:17:35,970
Speaker 1: position of that kind of experience is

337
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:41,460
Speaker 1: being free from I'm free from the mind, I'm

338
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,432
Speaker 1: free from identification with the body.

339
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,030
Speaker 1: I'm free from the mind, I'm free from

340
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,096
Speaker 1: identification with the body, I'm free from

341
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:49,102
Speaker 1: identification with time, I'm free from

342
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:51,550
Speaker 1: identification with the world.

343
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:11,121
Speaker 1: So if you're free from conscious and

344
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:15,506
Speaker 1: unconscious attachment and if you're free

345
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:18,152
Speaker 1: from longing for anything else than freedom,

346
00:18:20,214 --> 00:18:21,336
Speaker 1: you're going to be pretty enlightened,

347
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,099
Speaker 1: obviously.

348
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,056
Speaker 1: But there's another kind of enlightenment

349
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:34,440
Speaker 1: that I want to speak about that relates to

350
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:40,961
Speaker 1: the subject of this gathering today, which

351
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:48,947
Speaker 1: is living on the edge of evolution, which

352
00:18:48,987 --> 00:18:50,270
Speaker 1: is living on the edge of evolution.

353
00:18:51,071 --> 00:18:55,160
Speaker 1: So in the context of the inherent

354
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:04,427
Speaker 1: creativity, it is the manifest expression

355
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:04,990
Speaker 1: of the evolutionary impulse.

356
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,693
Speaker 1: When we look at enlightenment in the

357
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:11,312
Speaker 1: context of conscious evolution, we begin to

358
00:19:11,352 --> 00:19:12,617
Speaker 1: see a very different kind of picture,

359
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,196
Speaker 1: because the question in the evolutionary

360
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:19,058
Speaker 1: context is for you and for me, and for all

361
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,755
Speaker 1: of us that are interested in the subject,

362
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,959
Speaker 1: the question of how free we are can be

363
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,140
Speaker 1: answered.

364
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,941
Speaker 1: And when we subject, the question of how

365
00:19:25,961 --> 00:19:26,823
Speaker 1: free we are can be answered.

366
00:19:26,923 --> 00:19:28,371
Speaker 1: And when we look into the question of how

367
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:36,598
Speaker 1: free are we, are you and me?

368
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,274
Speaker 1: How free are we?

369
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,393
Speaker 1: How available?

370
00:19:41,657 --> 00:19:42,360
Speaker 1: How free are we?

371
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:55,762
Speaker 1: How available are we to be able to respond

372
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:57,186
Speaker 1: unconditionally to evolutionary potential?

373
00:19:57,206 --> 00:19:58,309
Speaker 1: How free am I to respond?

374
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,196
Speaker 1: How free are you to respond to the

375
00:20:03,216 --> 00:20:04,501
Speaker 1: recognition and to the revelation of

376
00:20:04,521 --> 00:20:06,368
Speaker 1: evolutionary potential as it appears within

377
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:06,790
Speaker 1: your heart and mind?

378
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:13,133
Speaker 1: Are we attached, distracted, busy with

379
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:13,775
Speaker 1: other things?

380
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:15,781
Speaker 1: Dug in?

381
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:23,975
Speaker 1: Is our lives hopelessly dug in, consciously

382
00:20:23,995 --> 00:20:28,818
Speaker 1: and unconsciously, and attached to first

383
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:32,737
Speaker 1: principles and first values that have

384
00:20:32,757 --> 00:20:34,240
Speaker 1: nothing to do with the inherent creativity

385
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:34,862
Speaker 1: of the universe?

386
00:20:37,994 --> 00:20:39,479
Speaker 1: Are we knowingly or unknowingly living in

387
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:47,020
Speaker 1: the past, living in old ideas about the

388
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,745
Speaker 1: meaning and purpose of life that have

389
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,474
Speaker 1: nothing to do with spiritual freedom and

390
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:54,200
Speaker 1: that have nothing to do with liberating our

391
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:55,223
Speaker 1: evolutionary potential?

392
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,273
Speaker 1: Because the most beautiful thing about the

393
00:21:00,313 --> 00:21:03,498
Speaker 1: discovery of evolution is that, because

394
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:08,946
Speaker 1: it's the recognition that the universe,

395
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,760
Speaker 1: that the creative process as a whole, is

396
00:21:12,861 --> 00:21:13,222
Speaker 1: moving.

397
00:21:14,552 --> 00:21:15,316
Speaker 1: It's not static.

398
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:19,046
Speaker 1: The energy and intelligence that created

399
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,614
Speaker 1: the universe and is creating the universe

400
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,279
Speaker 1: right now is moving.

401
00:21:24,972 --> 00:21:26,859
Speaker 1: It is always becoming more of what it can

402
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:28,336
Speaker 1: be intimate complexification.

403
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:33,962
Speaker 1: It's on a journey of self-discovery and

404
00:21:33,982 --> 00:21:36,454
Speaker 1: self-realization, as are all of us.

405
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:48,348
Speaker 1: So does the picture of reality that we use

406
00:21:48,368 --> 00:21:49,370
Speaker 1: to frame our experience.

407
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,895
Speaker 1: Is the picture of reality that we use to

408
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:51,899
Speaker 1: frame our experience?

409
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,297
Speaker 1: Is it a moving picture?

410
00:21:57,514 --> 00:21:59,420
Speaker 1: Do we see the reality of the present moment

411
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:04,222
Speaker 1: emerging out of an evolutionary continuum,

412
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:10,339
Speaker 1: or do we see ourselves as living in more or

413
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:15,496
Speaker 1: less a static frame based upon old ideas,

414
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:19,504
Speaker 1: whether these ideas are personal and

415
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:24,704
Speaker 1: psychological, related to our own unique

416
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:33,001
Speaker 1: souls, experience, or do we see ourself and

417
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:38,133
Speaker 1: our values, the values that we're

418
00:22:38,153 --> 00:22:39,672
Speaker 1: consciously and unconsciously attached to

419
00:22:39,712 --> 00:22:52,006
Speaker 1: and identified with as coming from an

420
00:22:52,468 --> 00:22:57,217
Speaker 1: outdated past, which those values no longer

421
00:22:57,257 --> 00:22:57,938
Speaker 1: are actually relevant anymore?

422
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,181
Speaker 1: What world are we knowingly and unknowingly

423
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:10,066
Speaker 1: choosing to live in, to be acting from and

424
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:10,588
Speaker 1: within?

425
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,547
Speaker 1: So, as you awaken to an evolutionary first

426
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:19,431
Speaker 1: values and first principles, the fact that

427
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:20,674
Speaker 1: the whole process, the whole universe is

428
00:23:20,694 --> 00:23:22,680
Speaker 1: moving and it's becoming and complexifying

429
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,772
Speaker 1: constantly and there's no such thing as

430
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:29,734
Speaker 1: anything static in this process, when you

431
00:23:29,794 --> 00:23:34,916
Speaker 1: really let that truth into your soul, when

432
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:40,940
Speaker 1: you feel, when you get to feel within your

433
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,524
Speaker 1: own consciousness the presence of the

434
00:23:42,544 --> 00:23:43,728
Speaker 1: vibration, the pulsation of the

435
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:46,770
Speaker 1: evolutionary impulse of this sense, this

436
00:23:46,871 --> 00:23:50,298
Speaker 1: feeling of movement and reaching towards

437
00:23:50,318 --> 00:23:53,156
Speaker 1: the future, and you see that all of reality

438
00:23:53,216 --> 00:23:57,057
Speaker 1: is moving, nothing is fixed and static.

439
00:24:00,594 --> 00:24:02,813
Speaker 1: And then you realize, in that context, you

440
00:24:02,853 --> 00:24:04,398
Speaker 1: begin to realize, to become aware of the

441
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:06,336
Speaker 1: fact that, as I've been saying, so many of

442
00:24:06,396 --> 00:24:10,778
Speaker 1: you are and our ideas, beliefs, attachments,

443
00:24:12,902 --> 00:24:16,856
Speaker 1: fixations, fears and desires are all

444
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,641
Speaker 1: emerging in a very static context.

445
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:21,236
Speaker 1: It's not ultimately real.

446
00:24:22,354 --> 00:24:23,750
Speaker 1: And not only is it not ultimately real, but

447
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,837
Speaker 1: it's not even in alignment with the

448
00:24:27,897 --> 00:24:29,742
Speaker 1: evolutionary becoming of the universe.

449
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:37,177
Speaker 1: As integral philosophy tells us and makes

450
00:24:37,217 --> 00:24:39,035
Speaker 1: clear to us, the universe has an inside and

451
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:39,678
Speaker 1: an outside.

452
00:24:42,391 --> 00:24:43,877
Speaker 1: The outside of the universe is matter and

453
00:24:43,937 --> 00:24:46,016
Speaker 1: energy and the universe in the inside of

454
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:50,436
Speaker 1: the universe is subjectivity and

455
00:24:50,476 --> 00:24:51,119
Speaker 1: consciousness.

456
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,755
Speaker 1: So as the exterior is part of a

457
00:24:54,776 --> 00:24:58,794
Speaker 1: developmental process it's been in progress

458
00:24:58,814 --> 00:25:03,413
Speaker 1: for about 14 billion years it makes perfect

459
00:25:03,453 --> 00:25:06,641
Speaker 1: sense that the inside of the universe, the

460
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:11,028
Speaker 1: within of all things, has also been on a

461
00:25:11,088 --> 00:25:11,570
Speaker 1: long journey.

462
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,413
Speaker 1: So is our experience of consciousness and

463
00:25:15,454 --> 00:25:24,762
Speaker 1: cognition and is our unique soul living in

464
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:30,087
Speaker 1: alignment with the evolutionary becoming of

465
00:25:30,107 --> 00:25:30,747
Speaker 1: the cosmos?

466
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:33,732
Speaker 1: Usually it's not the case.

467
00:25:44,903 --> 00:25:48,147
Speaker 1: How do we see ourselves as unique human

468
00:25:48,187 --> 00:25:48,427
Speaker 1: beings?

469
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,976
Speaker 1: How do we see ourselves in this picture?

470
00:25:54,996 --> 00:25:58,045
Speaker 1: Do we see ourselves experiencing at the

471
00:25:58,105 --> 00:26:01,255
Speaker 1: level of consciousness and cognition and at

472
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:02,580
Speaker 1: the level of our souls.

473
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,700
Speaker 1: Do we feel that inner momentum of the

474
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,675
Speaker 1: evolving cosmos reaching ever forward into

475
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:14,254
Speaker 1: the future, trying to give rise to its own

476
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:18,335
Speaker 1: creativity, leading edge of ensuring our

477
00:26:18,355 --> 00:26:18,797
Speaker 1: potentials?

478
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,319
Speaker 1: Do we feel that movement in ourselves?

479
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,876
Speaker 1: Do we feel ourselves looking towards the

480
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,534
Speaker 1: future, feeling towards the future?

481
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,342
Speaker 1: Do you feel within yourself a feeling

482
00:26:27,783 --> 00:26:30,070
Speaker 1: towards the future and in that feeling

483
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,017
Speaker 1: towards the future a great yearning, great

484
00:26:33,057 --> 00:26:35,323
Speaker 1: ecstatic yearning for what could be?

485
00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:39,132
Speaker 1: And in the context that I wish I'm sharing,

486
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:42,359
Speaker 1: this yearning for what could be is always

487
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:43,903
Speaker 1: that which has never existed before.

488
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,619
Speaker 1: It's always a higher and deeper possibility,

489
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:52,422
Speaker 1: it's always a step forward and a step up, a

490
00:26:52,462 --> 00:26:53,144
Speaker 1: step beyond.

491
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,916
Speaker 1: There's always a reaching, an ecstatic

492
00:26:57,478 --> 00:26:58,553
Speaker 1: reaching for the possible.

493
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,996
Speaker 1: And do you feel this reaching for the

494
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:06,622
Speaker 1: possible in your body, in your mind, in

495
00:27:06,642 --> 00:27:07,083
Speaker 1: your soul?

496
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:11,977
Speaker 1: Because in an evolutionarily inspired and

497
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:17,653
Speaker 1: informed enlightenment, the expression of

498
00:27:17,673 --> 00:27:21,341
Speaker 1: that enlightenment in time and space is the

499
00:27:21,822 --> 00:27:22,484
Speaker 1: liberated.

500
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,915
Speaker 1: Is the liberated liberated willingness and

501
00:27:29,935 --> 00:27:32,480
Speaker 1: ability to respond without hesitation,

502
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,943
Speaker 1: fearlessly, to evolutionary opportunity.

503
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:41,458
Speaker 1: It means that you're available.

504
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:45,879
Speaker 1: It means that you're available, it means

505
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:46,862
Speaker 1: that one is available.

506
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:50,390
Speaker 1: Most people aren't really very available

507
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:54,173
Speaker 1: because we're stuck in old paradigms, old

508
00:27:54,213 --> 00:28:00,018
Speaker 1: beliefs, old ways of thinking, feeling,

509
00:28:02,363 --> 00:28:07,574
Speaker 1: desiring, old forms of attachment that

510
00:28:07,594 --> 00:28:09,039
Speaker 1: might have been at the very leading edge or

511
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:14,120
Speaker 1: cutting edge 500 years ago, 400 years ago,

512
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,492
Speaker 1: 300 years ago, 200 years ago, 100 years ago,

513
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:20,802
Speaker 1: 50 years ago, maybe even 20 years ago.

514
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:25,217
Speaker 1: So to live on the very edge of evolution

515
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:29,801
Speaker 1: means that, means that we've aligned

516
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,649
Speaker 1: ourself with, consciously and deliberately

517
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:36,804
Speaker 1: chosen to align ourselves so profoundly

518
00:28:36,844 --> 00:28:41,593
Speaker 1: with this evolutionary principle that we

519
00:28:41,974 --> 00:28:49,141
Speaker 1: are spiritually and energetically and

520
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:58,899
Speaker 1: morally available to respond to the

521
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:00,683
Speaker 1: evolutionary potential that reveals itself.

522
00:29:08,107 --> 00:29:09,250
Speaker 1: Evolutionary potential that reveals itself.

523
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,137
Speaker 1: If we're gonna be living on the edge of, if

524
00:29:11,157 --> 00:29:13,107
Speaker 1: we're gonna be living on the very edge of

525
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:15,534
Speaker 1: evolution, it means we have to be ready to

526
00:29:15,574 --> 00:29:19,731
Speaker 1: respond, and we can only respond if we're

527
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:21,498
Speaker 1: committed to being ready to respond.

528
00:29:24,491 --> 00:29:25,398
Speaker 1: And if we're going to be ready to respond,

529
00:29:25,418 --> 00:29:26,346
Speaker 1: and if we're going to be ready to respond

530
00:29:26,387 --> 00:29:29,819
Speaker 1: at all, it means that our philosophy, that

531
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:32,353
Speaker 1: our life philosophy, our personal religious

532
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:37,393
Speaker 1: impulses, would have to be aligned in a

533
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:38,978
Speaker 1: profound and significant way with the

534
00:29:39,018 --> 00:29:40,261
Speaker 1: evolutionary impulse itself.

535
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:43,777
Speaker 1: And the evolutionary impulse is an

536
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:47,439
Speaker 1: experience of ecstatic urgency and a

537
00:29:47,459 --> 00:30:19,987
Speaker 1: spiritually palpable feeling of

538
00:30:20,047 --> 00:30:20,588
Speaker 1: evolutionary potential.

539
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:22,176
Speaker 1: But that's something we have to.

540
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:23,407
Speaker 1: We have to, we have to, we have to make

541
00:30:23,427 --> 00:30:23,810
Speaker 1: ourselves free.

542
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:28,023
Speaker 1: But that's something we have to make

543
00:30:28,063 --> 00:30:28,745
Speaker 1: ourselves free.

544
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:32,860
Speaker 1: We have to become free so that we will be

545
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,737
Speaker 1: available to respond to the call of

546
00:30:35,757 --> 00:30:36,198
Speaker 1: evolution.

547
00:30:43,272 --> 00:30:45,020
Speaker 1: So there's a distinction I often like to

548
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,688
Speaker 1: make in the teaching of evolutionary

549
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:49,155
Speaker 1: enlightenment, which I want to briefly

550
00:30:50,177 --> 00:30:52,122
Speaker 1: bring up here because it's a good time to

551
00:30:52,162 --> 00:30:55,755
Speaker 1: do it, and that is in the practice of what

552
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:58,642
Speaker 1: I was explaining is my definition of the

553
00:30:58,682 --> 00:30:59,684
Speaker 1: traditional enlightenment.

554
00:31:01,812 --> 00:31:03,739
Speaker 1: The being enlightenment, the enlightenment

555
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:06,791
Speaker 1: of the Buddha, the enlightenment that

556
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:11,304
Speaker 1: Akartali talks about so beautifully, is the

557
00:31:11,344 --> 00:31:12,187
Speaker 1: way to realize.

558
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:20,781
Speaker 1: The being enlightenment is usually what

559
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:22,503
Speaker 1: happens is when you have a realization,

560
00:31:22,563 --> 00:31:24,426
Speaker 1: when you experience a spiritual insight,

561
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:28,813
Speaker 1: moment of depth, experience, a higher state

562
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:30,539
Speaker 1: of consciousness, consciousness of being

563
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,651
Speaker 1: timeless, formless, beginningless, endless,

564
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:34,238
Speaker 1: eternal being, eternal freedom.

565
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:40,130
Speaker 1: The response to those kinds of experiences

566
00:31:41,514 --> 00:31:43,721
Speaker 1: always is to let go.

567
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,638
Speaker 1: And the more you let go into having nothing,

568
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:52,028
Speaker 1: knowing nothing and being no one, zero, the

569
00:31:52,068 --> 00:31:56,059
Speaker 1: more freedom you will experience as being.

570
00:31:58,032 --> 00:31:58,132
Speaker 1: So.

571
00:31:58,173 --> 00:32:02,455
Speaker 1: In the being enlightenment it's realize and

572
00:32:02,496 --> 00:32:10,016
Speaker 1: let go, and we find for most of us there's

573
00:32:10,076 --> 00:32:11,081
Speaker 1: always more to let go of.

574
00:32:12,836 --> 00:32:14,412
Speaker 1: Even if you're good at letting go and even

575
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:18,167
Speaker 1: if you let go of a lot, one finds that in

576
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:19,715
Speaker 1: most cases there's always more to go.

577
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:23,231
Speaker 1: So realize and let go is the practice of

578
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:23,895
Speaker 1: being enlightenment.

579
00:32:23,935 --> 00:32:24,921
Speaker 1: To put it in so realize and let go is the

580
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:25,665
Speaker 1: practice of being enlightenment.

581
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:27,437
Speaker 1: To put it in a nutshell realize and let go,

582
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,917
Speaker 1: realize and let go, realize and let go.

583
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,619
Speaker 1: But in the evolutionarily inspired

584
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:39,393
Speaker 1: enlightenment, the kind of enlightenment

585
00:32:39,414 --> 00:32:41,384
Speaker 1: that reveals itself to us when we awaken to

586
00:32:41,456 --> 00:32:42,861
Speaker 1: the evolutionary impulse, that reveals

587
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:46,229
Speaker 1: itself to us when we awaken to the

588
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:47,433
Speaker 1: evolutionary impulse, In evolutionary

589
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:49,795
Speaker 1: enlightenment and evolutionarily inspired

590
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:52,472
Speaker 1: enlightenment it's very different than it's

591
00:32:53,876 --> 00:32:59,535
Speaker 1: realize and respond, realize and respond.

592
00:32:59,756 --> 00:33:03,595
Speaker 1: Now, realize and respond.

593
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,093
Speaker 1: So if you in other words it means if you

594
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:07,655
Speaker 1: realize if in a moment of spiritual

595
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:10,262
Speaker 1: realization, spiritual insight, you realize

596
00:33:13,198 --> 00:33:16,898
Speaker 1: a great potential that wants to actualize

597
00:33:16,938 --> 00:33:19,036
Speaker 1: itself within you or in the world around

598
00:33:19,096 --> 00:33:21,347
Speaker 1: you, the world that you occupy you realize

599
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:25,076
Speaker 1: a great potential that wants to actualize

600
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:30,136
Speaker 1: itself, then what you would do if you were

601
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,851
Speaker 1: free, if you were liberated, would be to,

602
00:33:31,892 --> 00:33:34,139
Speaker 1: without hesitation, respond to what you

603
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:34,640
Speaker 1: realized.

604
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,899
Speaker 1: You wouldn't wait, you wouldn't hesitate,

605
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:40,475
Speaker 1: you wouldn't have a cigarette.

606
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:41,579
Speaker 1: Think about it.

607
00:33:43,551 --> 00:33:45,658
Speaker 1: You take the leap of faith because you'd

608
00:33:45,698 --> 00:33:48,872
Speaker 1: seen what's possible and because you see

609
00:33:48,912 --> 00:33:50,996
Speaker 1: yourself in that context as an instrument

610
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,504
Speaker 1: of evolution in human form.

611
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,517
Speaker 1: You would act immediately, without

612
00:33:58,557 --> 00:34:00,951
Speaker 1: hesitation, with total faith, what you'd

613
00:34:01,012 --> 00:34:03,401
Speaker 1: seen, the more you could do that.

614
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,530
Speaker 1: Then what you see as mere potential

615
00:34:06,193 --> 00:34:10,734
Speaker 1: eventually becomes actualized materially in

616
00:34:10,754 --> 00:34:13,321
Speaker 1: the world that you helped to give rise to

617
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,297
Speaker 1: and co-create through your presence here in

618
00:34:15,317 --> 00:34:15,719
Speaker 1: the world.

619
00:34:17,351 --> 00:34:19,270
Speaker 1: So an evolutionarily inspired enlightenment

620
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:22,873
Speaker 1: is not realize and let go, it's realize and

621
00:34:22,914 --> 00:34:23,396
Speaker 1: respond.

622
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,336
Speaker 1: So, therefore, to live on the very edge of

623
00:34:26,437 --> 00:34:29,750
Speaker 1: evolution, to live on the edge of evolution

624
00:34:29,911 --> 00:34:34,176
Speaker 1: also implies that we would become agents of

625
00:34:34,216 --> 00:34:36,522
Speaker 1: the actualization of evolutionary potential.

626
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,138
Speaker 1: It would mean that you were spiritually

627
00:34:39,198 --> 00:34:42,954
Speaker 1: prepared, spiritually prepared, spiritually

628
00:34:43,716 --> 00:34:48,628
Speaker 1: equipped to realize and respond when,

629
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:51,157
Speaker 1: sometime around now-ish.

630
00:34:53,731 --> 00:34:55,436
Speaker 1: Remember enlightenment, whether it's being

631
00:34:55,476 --> 00:34:57,041
Speaker 1: enlightened or revolutionary, enlightenment

632
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,936
Speaker 1: is always about transcending ego.

633
00:35:02,251 --> 00:35:03,316
Speaker 1: Enlightenment, whether it's being

634
00:35:03,356 --> 00:35:04,761
Speaker 1: enlightened or evolutionary enlightenment,

635
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,850
Speaker 1: is always about transcending ego.

636
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:12,303
Speaker 1: Always just to repeat in case anybody

637
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:14,529
Speaker 1: wasn't listening enlightenment's always

638
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:15,531
Speaker 1: about transcending ego.

639
00:35:15,551 --> 00:35:20,378
Speaker 1: So, in evolutionary enlightenment, if you

640
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:24,043
Speaker 1: realize and respond without hesitating, in

641
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:28,494
Speaker 1: an act of total faith, your ego has no time

642
00:35:28,534 --> 00:35:29,698
Speaker 1: to interfere with you.

643
00:35:30,351 --> 00:35:33,776
Speaker 1: No, but I, the ego, is very good at

644
00:35:33,856 --> 00:35:36,748
Speaker 1: interfering in the arising of evolutionary

645
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:38,295
Speaker 1: potential and in the actualization of

646
00:35:38,355 --> 00:35:39,258
Speaker 1: evolutionary potential.

647
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:41,947
Speaker 1: The ego always has good excuses, good

648
00:35:41,987 --> 00:35:44,257
Speaker 1: reasons, especially if smart people come up

649
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:46,509
Speaker 1: with very good reasons, very good excuses,

650
00:35:47,137 --> 00:35:48,882
Speaker 1: and the ego will always phrase the excuse

651
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:50,576
Speaker 1: of the good reason with no, but I.

652
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:53,299
Speaker 1: So the way it works is if you respond

653
00:35:54,015 --> 00:35:55,606
Speaker 1: immediately, without hesitation, without

654
00:35:55,646 --> 00:35:59,788
Speaker 1: reservation, the ego has no chance to

655
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:00,230
Speaker 1: interfere.

656
00:36:02,939 --> 00:36:05,737
Speaker 1: And the more, the more you and I and we can

657
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:08,874
Speaker 1: learn how to respond to life without

658
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:11,541
Speaker 1: allowing our unenlightened egos to mess the

659
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:13,776
Speaker 1: whole thing up, which the ego very much

660
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:17,318
Speaker 1: likes to do we can make some real progress

661
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,795
Speaker 1: Progress in terms of the evolution of

662
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:22,395
Speaker 1: consciousness, progress in terms of the

663
00:36:24,743 --> 00:36:26,530
Speaker 1: actualization of evolutionary potential,

664
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:29,518
Speaker 1: progress in relationship to the liberation

665
00:36:29,558 --> 00:36:30,622
Speaker 1: of evolutionary potential.

666
00:36:36,117 --> 00:36:39,350
Speaker 1: When you get really good at this, the

667
00:36:39,411 --> 00:36:41,477
Speaker 1: becoming of the cosmos, the becoming of the

668
00:36:41,537 --> 00:36:45,493
Speaker 1: interior of the cosmos, becomes palpably

669
00:36:47,176 --> 00:36:52,725
Speaker 1: discernible within and between human actors.

670
00:36:54,814 --> 00:36:56,470
Speaker 1: And that's when the show gets very exciting,

671
00:36:56,751 --> 00:37:01,861
Speaker 1: when you go wow, we're really on a journey

672
00:37:01,901 --> 00:37:02,984
Speaker 1: of becoming, aren't we?

673
00:37:03,711 --> 00:37:04,695
Speaker 1: And we're going somewhere.

674
00:37:04,735 --> 00:37:09,137
Speaker 1: Baby, it's happening in us and through us

675
00:37:09,178 --> 00:37:09,879
Speaker 1: and between us.

676
00:37:11,482 --> 00:37:12,044
Speaker 1: What's happening?

677
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:13,855
Speaker 1: It's the energy and intelligence that

678
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:15,179
Speaker 1: created the universe and is creating the

679
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:20,073
Speaker 1: universe, which means God, she's the only

680
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,158
Speaker 1: one who could have created the universe.

681
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:24,740
Speaker 1: It's becoming more conscious, more palpably

682
00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:35,543
Speaker 1: present as the only actor that it truly is

683
00:37:36,433 --> 00:37:37,116
Speaker 1: through us.

684
00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:41,739
Speaker 1: And when you see this, when you feel this

685
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,074
Speaker 1: and you know it's true, because it starts

686
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,812
Speaker 1: happening through you, that's when your

687
00:37:46,852 --> 00:37:49,917
Speaker 1: spiritual self-confidence goes through the

688
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:50,218
Speaker 1: roof.

689
00:37:52,913 --> 00:37:53,521
Speaker 1: Did you realize?

690
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:54,712
Speaker 1: The energy and intelligence that created

691
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:58,053
Speaker 1: the universe the evolutionary impulse is

692
00:37:58,153 --> 00:38:04,126
Speaker 1: the spiritual principle that makes all

693
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:06,116
Speaker 1: things possible is actually at work through

694
00:38:06,216 --> 00:38:06,276
Speaker 1: us.

695
00:38:07,515 --> 00:38:10,736
Speaker 1: You realize that we're not victims of a

696
00:38:10,757 --> 00:38:15,991
Speaker 1: material process, that we're not victims of

697
00:38:16,071 --> 00:38:18,512
Speaker 1: a painful material process, trying to do

698
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:20,877
Speaker 1: the best we can but failing again and again.

699
00:38:24,584 --> 00:38:26,492
Speaker 1: But at the deepest level we begin to

700
00:38:26,573 --> 00:38:29,332
Speaker 1: recognize what a profound role we actually

701
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:32,511
Speaker 1: are here to play in the unfolding of this

702
00:38:32,631 --> 00:38:37,463
Speaker 1: inner intelligence that's so present in the

703
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,218
Speaker 1: process, which is normally so invisible to

704
00:38:40,338 --> 00:38:40,418
Speaker 1: us.

705
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,256
Speaker 1: So living on the edge of evolution means we

706
00:38:47,377 --> 00:38:51,435
Speaker 1: are available to actualize what becomes

707
00:38:51,716 --> 00:38:53,293
Speaker 1: apparent to us in our deepest moments of

708
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:56,372
Speaker 1: self-realization, our states of

709
00:38:56,432 --> 00:38:57,055
Speaker 1: consciousness.

710
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,574
Speaker 1: Because when make-wit creates evolutionary

711
00:39:02,714 --> 00:39:06,963
Speaker 1: momentum, creates the inner momentum, I can

712
00:39:06,983 --> 00:39:11,387
Speaker 1: learn to respond unselfconsciously, without

713
00:39:11,447 --> 00:39:13,175
Speaker 1: fear and doubt to interfere.

714
00:39:13,236 --> 00:39:16,855
Speaker 1: Every time I have an insight that's coming

715
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,600
Speaker 1: from the deepest part of me, my awakened

716
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:25,657
Speaker 1: soul, the momentum of the possible begins

717
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,557
Speaker 1: to be at work in and through my body and

718
00:39:28,597 --> 00:39:28,918
Speaker 1: mind.

719
00:39:31,979 --> 00:39:36,792
Speaker 1: You become engines of evolution, of

720
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:47,475
Speaker 1: evolutionary potential, and lord knows, the

721
00:39:47,495 --> 00:39:49,959
Speaker 1: world needs as much of that as possible now

722
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:50,580
Speaker 1: more than ever.

723
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:13,048
Speaker 1: So the edge of revolution, the way I'm

724
00:40:13,148 --> 00:40:15,993
Speaker 1: describing doesn't live outside you.

725
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,537
Speaker 1: So a big part of how I would define the new,

726
00:40:18,757 --> 00:40:20,380
Speaker 1: the new enlightenment, is that we need to

727
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:25,735
Speaker 1: find first we need to do the spiritual work

728
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:34,117
Speaker 1: to awaken to and discover the evolutionary

729
00:40:34,137 --> 00:40:37,488
Speaker 1: impulse within our own selves, because it

730
00:40:37,548 --> 00:40:38,291
Speaker 1: exists within you.

731
00:40:38,545 --> 00:40:40,831
Speaker 1: The evolutionary impulse exists within you

732
00:40:40,891 --> 00:40:43,317
Speaker 1: as a palpable vibration and pulsation.

733
00:40:44,126 --> 00:40:44,930
Speaker 1: It's already there.

734
00:40:46,085 --> 00:40:47,550
Speaker 1: You just got to discover it and when you do,

735
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:48,926
Speaker 1: you're going to get very excited because it

736
00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:54,897
Speaker 1: feels so powerful, so potent, so pregnant

737
00:40:54,917 --> 00:40:57,168
Speaker 1: with creativity and so alive and so full of

738
00:40:57,229 --> 00:40:58,133
Speaker 1: pure positivity.

739
00:40:59,986 --> 00:41:01,812
Speaker 1: The evolutionary impulse as a felt

740
00:41:01,853 --> 00:41:08,058
Speaker 1: experience feels like pure, unabashed,

741
00:41:08,685 --> 00:41:13,568
Speaker 1: uncorrupted, unobstructed, overwhelming

742
00:41:13,689 --> 00:41:14,352
Speaker 1: positivity.

743
00:41:15,885 --> 00:41:19,057
Speaker 1: And what it feels like inside you, inside

744
00:41:19,117 --> 00:41:21,590
Speaker 1: me, feels like suddenly all things are

745
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,052
Speaker 1: possible.

746
00:41:22,205 --> 00:41:42,949
Speaker 1: Not naively so, but it's a liberated

747
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:44,192
Speaker 1: experience of pure potential.

748
00:41:44,212 --> 00:41:45,855
Speaker 1: And it feels so good because you will

749
00:41:45,915 --> 00:41:48,279
Speaker 1: suddenly feel all things are possible.

750
00:41:50,626 --> 00:41:56,413
Speaker 1: Ego, trauma about experiences, unfortunate

751
00:41:56,433 --> 00:42:00,458
Speaker 1: events, great fear, doubt and cynicism

752
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:06,354
Speaker 1: about life itself, life itself.

753
00:42:06,374 --> 00:42:11,733
Speaker 1: So many human beings these days, for so

754
00:42:11,753 --> 00:42:14,507
Speaker 1: many reasonable good reasons, are

755
00:42:14,527 --> 00:42:15,391
Speaker 1: consciously and unconsciously seem to be

756
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:17,059
Speaker 1: convinced that life is not such a good

757
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,912
Speaker 1: thing, to be alive is not such a good thing,

758
00:42:21,445 --> 00:42:27,708
Speaker 1: that a human birth is not a great gift and

759
00:42:27,728 --> 00:42:29,802
Speaker 1: that life and death is full of so many

760
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:31,591
Speaker 1: problems and that so little is possible.

761
00:42:33,506 --> 00:42:35,934
Speaker 1: People feel this on a personal level

762
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:39,174
Speaker 1: because they personally had bad experiences

763
00:42:39,235 --> 00:42:39,776
Speaker 1: in the past.

764
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:45,665
Speaker 1: You can feel very discouraged and depressed

765
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:48,531
Speaker 1: by human potential in general because of

766
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:52,299
Speaker 1: what a mess in so many areas we're making.

767
00:42:53,686 --> 00:42:55,529
Speaker 1: So this can lead to willingly or

768
00:42:55,629 --> 00:42:57,413
Speaker 1: unwillingly, consciously or unconsciously,

769
00:42:58,675 --> 00:43:00,999
Speaker 1: a tendency towards nihilism, cynicism and

770
00:43:01,059 --> 00:43:01,340
Speaker 1: doubt.

771
00:43:07,446 --> 00:43:08,811
Speaker 1: And have no doubt that nihilism, cynicism

772
00:43:08,831 --> 00:43:15,514
Speaker 1: and doubt are suicidal tendencies if you're

773
00:43:15,554 --> 00:43:18,365
Speaker 1: actually interested in spiritual awakening

774
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:19,931
Speaker 1: and enlightenment.

775
00:43:19,951 --> 00:43:22,771
Speaker 1: Most of all, we're all vulnerable.

776
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:28,171
Speaker 1: We have to be very careful where we spend

777
00:43:28,211 --> 00:43:29,636
Speaker 1: our time with our minds.

778
00:43:32,366 --> 00:43:34,770
Speaker 1: We've got to think about life

779
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:42,849
Speaker 1: philosophically, ethically, emotionally,

780
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:44,672
Speaker 1: psychologically and spiritually in ways

781
00:43:44,692 --> 00:43:47,879
Speaker 1: that are very positive and in ways that

782
00:43:47,899 --> 00:43:50,725
Speaker 1: will help us to nurture our own potential

783
00:43:50,885 --> 00:43:54,556
Speaker 1: for liberation.

784
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:03,462
Speaker 1: So when you awaken to the evolutionary

785
00:44:03,482 --> 00:44:07,372
Speaker 1: potential, you will feel all things are

786
00:44:07,412 --> 00:44:10,798
Speaker 1: possible as a state, as an experience, of a

787
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:11,760
Speaker 1: state of consciousness.

788
00:44:13,346 --> 00:44:14,592
Speaker 1: It's not that it's going to be easy.

789
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:22,055
Speaker 1: The experience of the revelation that all

790
00:44:22,075 --> 00:44:24,320
Speaker 1: things are possible doesn't mean all things

791
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,824
Speaker 1: becoming possible is going to be part of an

792
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:26,345
Speaker 1: easy ride.

793
00:44:26,405 --> 00:44:28,290
Speaker 1: It might be a very hard ride but

794
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,754
Speaker 1: fundamentally know fundamentally you can do

795
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,117
Speaker 1: it and it can be done.

796
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,331
Speaker 1: It's the opposite of cynicism and nihilism

797
00:44:39,755 --> 00:44:40,156
Speaker 1: and doubt.

798
00:44:42,707 --> 00:44:57,056
Speaker 1: There is a you experience a kind of

799
00:44:57,116 --> 00:45:00,220
Speaker 1: conviction, a conviction of the inherent

800
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:06,128
Speaker 1: goodness of life and of the will to exist

801
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:09,113
Speaker 1: which is inherent in the universe, inherent

802
00:45:09,153 --> 00:45:10,055
Speaker 1: in the evolutionary impulse.

803
00:45:10,095 --> 00:45:12,779
Speaker 1: If you get to become conscious of that will

804
00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:16,547
Speaker 1: to exist, it is the creative impulse, it is

805
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:17,610
Speaker 1: the evolutionary impulse and you feel the

806
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,477
Speaker 1: pure positivity that is driving it.

807
00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:24,268
Speaker 1: You start to recognize that that pure

808
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,151
Speaker 1: positivity that's driving the evolutionary

809
00:45:25,171 --> 00:45:27,950
Speaker 1: impulse is not separate from the very best

810
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,675
Speaker 1: part of who you are, who I am and who we

811
00:45:29,735 --> 00:45:31,790
Speaker 1: all are, and you go, wow really.

812
00:45:32,706 --> 00:45:34,229
Speaker 1: So then you discover that this inherent

813
00:45:34,249 --> 00:45:37,496
Speaker 1: positivity is what's driving this whole

814
00:45:37,516 --> 00:45:39,945
Speaker 1: process in the first place, and a

815
00:45:39,985 --> 00:45:41,470
Speaker 1: materialist will never believe you, but if

816
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,014
Speaker 1: you have the experience you realize that's

817
00:45:43,095 --> 00:45:49,790
Speaker 1: actually true Doesn't mean that life isn't

818
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:53,181
Speaker 1: hard and tough and full of paradoxes and

819
00:45:53,221 --> 00:45:55,431
Speaker 1: contradictions and pain and suffering.

820
00:45:55,471 --> 00:45:58,130
Speaker 1: I'm not saying that, but I'm saying that

821
00:45:58,191 --> 00:46:01,577
Speaker 1: the energy and intelligence that's driving

822
00:46:01,597 --> 00:46:05,555
Speaker 1: this process, it's a very core of

823
00:46:05,595 --> 00:46:09,431
Speaker 1: everything Inherited.

824
00:46:09,471 --> 00:46:11,087
Speaker 1: It is the kind of positivity that we can't

825
00:46:11,128 --> 00:46:12,673
Speaker 1: even begin to imagine with our minds.

826
00:46:15,267 --> 00:46:16,941
Speaker 1: So the idea is, if we live on the very edge

827
00:46:16,961 --> 00:46:18,553
Speaker 1: of evolution, we want to be in touch with

828
00:46:18,573 --> 00:46:20,365
Speaker 1: that positivity.

829
00:46:20,706 --> 00:46:25,527
Speaker 1: That's not mind created, it's revealed to

830
00:46:25,608 --> 00:46:29,757
Speaker 1: us in spiritual revelation and it's being

831
00:46:29,797 --> 00:46:31,388
Speaker 1: in contact with that kind of positivity

832
00:46:31,428 --> 00:46:33,574
Speaker 1: that gives us the courage to live the

833
00:46:33,594 --> 00:46:36,729
Speaker 1: spiritual life in earnest in a frightened

834
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:40,017
Speaker 1: and confused and understandably frightened

835
00:46:40,037 --> 00:46:40,798
Speaker 1: and confused world.

836
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:47,014
Speaker 1: The spiritual life must be lived in earnest,

837
00:46:48,928 --> 00:46:51,095
Speaker 1: which means we really mean it.

838
00:46:55,906 --> 00:46:57,370
Speaker 1: It means we're not afraid to live our

839
00:46:58,393 --> 00:47:00,479
Speaker 1: spiritual values and our convictions in

840
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:06,923
Speaker 1: public because we realize that for the true

841
00:47:06,983 --> 00:47:08,448
Speaker 1: nature of spirit to be able to reveal

842
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:11,187
Speaker 1: herself in a disbelieving world, some of us

843
00:47:11,227 --> 00:47:12,994
Speaker 1: have to be willing to bear witness.

844
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:17,215
Speaker 1: It's not a new idea, but it's actually true.

845
00:47:22,567 --> 00:47:23,270
Speaker 1: It takes courage.

846
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:27,153
Speaker 1: I can hear myself starting to starting to

847
00:47:27,173 --> 00:47:27,896
Speaker 1: sound like a Christian.

848
00:47:28,366 --> 00:47:29,311
Speaker 1: I'm laughing at myself.

849
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:35,414
Speaker 1: But we human beings emotionally,

850
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:38,359
Speaker 1: psychologically, philosophically,

851
00:47:38,485 --> 00:47:39,992
Speaker 1: metaphysically, tend to be very weak.

852
00:47:41,566 --> 00:47:43,657
Speaker 1: Very few of us have the courage or the

853
00:47:43,698 --> 00:47:45,246
Speaker 1: conviction of the strength of character and

854
00:47:45,266 --> 00:47:47,472
Speaker 1: strength at the level of the soul to truly

855
00:47:47,512 --> 00:47:50,653
Speaker 1: stand on our own two feet, independently.

856
00:47:53,486 --> 00:47:55,370
Speaker 1: And it takes courage, in a disbelieving

857
00:47:57,214 --> 00:47:58,978
Speaker 1: modern and postmodern world that is so

858
00:48:00,607 --> 00:48:06,737
Speaker 1: skewed by materialism and narcissism, to

859
00:48:06,756 --> 00:48:08,920
Speaker 1: have the courage to bear witness to real

860
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:09,240
Speaker 1: depth.

861
00:48:14,487 --> 00:48:16,473
Speaker 1: Just because there's so much narcissism and

862
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:21,354
Speaker 1: materialism and small-mindedness and

863
00:48:21,414 --> 00:48:25,549
Speaker 1: selfishness and ignorance, doesn't mean

864
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:30,378
Speaker 1: that depth, beauty and perfection doesn't

865
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:32,572
Speaker 1: exist at a deeper level it does.

866
00:48:34,686 --> 00:48:36,170
Speaker 1: Just because many people haven't found it

867
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:38,636
Speaker 1: yet or just stumbled upon it doesn't mean

868
00:48:38,676 --> 00:48:39,197
Speaker 1: it's not there.

869
00:48:40,745 --> 00:48:42,548
Speaker 1: But those of us who have had the good

870
00:48:42,608 --> 00:48:48,096
Speaker 1: fortune and the good karma and the grace

871
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:51,420
Speaker 1: has stumbled upon that perennial truth

872
00:48:53,365 --> 00:48:53,847
Speaker 1: Sooner or later.

873
00:48:53,867 --> 00:48:55,273
Speaker 1: We have to have the courage to bear witness

874
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:58,206
Speaker 1: in our own ways, whatever that means being

875
00:48:58,246 --> 00:48:59,311
Speaker 1: different things to different people.

876
00:49:05,187 --> 00:49:08,407
Speaker 1: So living on the edge of evolution means

877
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:12,214
Speaker 1: all these things and more than anything

878
00:49:12,234 --> 00:49:12,355
Speaker 1: else.

879
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:15,873
Speaker 1: It means because I have awakened to the

880
00:49:15,913 --> 00:49:17,557
Speaker 1: evolutionary impulse, because I know that

881
00:49:19,511 --> 00:49:23,298
Speaker 1: the absolute principle behind the creative

882
00:49:23,318 --> 00:49:24,686
Speaker 1: process, the energy, intelligence that

883
00:49:24,706 --> 00:49:26,131
Speaker 1: created the universe, the evolutionary

884
00:49:26,212 --> 00:49:30,072
Speaker 1: impulse, is who and what God actually is.

885
00:49:33,786 --> 00:49:35,612
Speaker 1: And that creative impulse, in order to

886
00:49:35,653 --> 00:49:37,408
Speaker 1: create the future at the highest level,

887
00:49:37,488 --> 00:49:42,072
Speaker 1: needs me, needs you, to be available and

888
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:43,075
Speaker 1: ready to respond.

889
00:49:51,485 --> 00:49:53,552
Speaker 1: Because when we wake up, when you wake up

890
00:49:53,572 --> 00:49:55,278
Speaker 1: to all of this, you realize what's called

891
00:49:55,339 --> 00:49:57,265
Speaker 1: evolutionary non-duality and you begin to

892
00:49:57,325 --> 00:50:01,351
Speaker 1: see how your hands and feet, your heart,

893
00:50:01,391 --> 00:50:04,375
Speaker 1: your eyes and your ears and your mind are

894
00:50:04,395 --> 00:50:07,320
Speaker 1: not your own, but they are the eyes, feet,

895
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:14,185
Speaker 1: heart, eyes, feet, hands, heart and mind of

896
00:50:14,205 --> 00:50:15,449
Speaker 1: the energy and intelligence that created

897
00:50:15,469 --> 00:50:16,010
Speaker 1: the universe.

898
00:50:17,374 --> 00:50:18,056
Speaker 1: They're not yours.

899
00:50:20,105 --> 00:50:21,511
Speaker 1: The ego is a very small part of a much

900
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:22,053
Speaker 1: bigger picture.

901
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:22,869
Speaker 1: The ego is just a.

902
00:50:26,185 --> 00:50:27,953
Speaker 1: The ego is useful because it helps your.

903
00:50:28,717 --> 00:50:29,806
Speaker 1: It makes it possible for you to have a

904
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:32,051
Speaker 1: frontal self, a frontal personality through

905
00:50:32,091 --> 00:50:34,845
Speaker 1: which that energy and intelligence, that

906
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:36,132
Speaker 1: creative energy and intelligence, can

907
00:50:36,193 --> 00:50:38,545
Speaker 1: express itself, through a frontal self and

908
00:50:38,565 --> 00:50:39,548
Speaker 1: frontal personality.

909
00:50:39,588 --> 00:50:43,141
Speaker 1: So in that sense the ego is not a problem.

910
00:50:43,161 --> 00:50:45,006
Speaker 1: But the ego becomes a problem when it

911
00:50:45,046 --> 00:50:47,571
Speaker 1: thinks that it's the center of the universe

912
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:51,378
Speaker 1: and the organizing principle behind all

913
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:52,179
Speaker 1: this, and it's not.

914
00:51:11,545 --> 00:51:12,447
Speaker 1: Body, mind and soul are here for a reason

915
00:51:12,467 --> 00:51:13,229
Speaker 1: and they're here to participate in the

916
00:51:13,249 --> 00:51:14,592
Speaker 1: evolutionary process as consciously as is

917
00:51:14,673 --> 00:51:16,657
Speaker 1: possible for you, for your unique soul.

918
00:51:19,468 --> 00:51:21,177
Speaker 1: The universe becomes conscious through you

919
00:51:21,197 --> 00:51:22,525
Speaker 1: and the universe becomes conscious through

920
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:23,851
Speaker 1: me and becomes conscious through us.

921
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:25,791
Speaker 1: The universe is not inherently conscious

922
00:51:25,831 --> 00:51:26,072
Speaker 1: out there.

923
00:51:26,093 --> 00:51:27,158
Speaker 1: The universe is not inherently conscious

924
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:28,123
Speaker 1: out there.

925
00:51:29,465 --> 00:51:30,851
Speaker 1: The universe is not inherently conscious

926
00:51:30,932 --> 00:51:31,293
Speaker 1: out there.

927
00:51:31,905 --> 00:51:33,952
Speaker 1: To repeat, the universe is not inherently

928
00:51:33,992 --> 00:51:34,635
Speaker 1: conscious out there.

929
00:51:34,745 --> 00:51:38,187
Speaker 1: The universe is conscious in here, within

930
00:51:38,267 --> 00:51:39,010
Speaker 1: us and between us.

931
00:51:40,825 --> 00:51:43,273
Speaker 1: And the universe can become more conscious

932
00:51:44,705 --> 00:51:45,890
Speaker 1: within us and between us.

933
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:47,316
Speaker 1: The universe out here can become more

934
00:51:47,336 --> 00:51:48,179
Speaker 1: conscious within us and between us.

935
00:51:48,199 --> 00:51:49,123
Speaker 1: The universe out here can become more

936
00:51:49,163 --> 00:51:56,929
Speaker 1: conscious within us and between us if we're

937
00:51:56,949 --> 00:51:59,015
Speaker 1: willing to live the spiritual life in

938
00:51:59,096 --> 00:52:00,611
Speaker 1: earnest, the religious life in earnest.

939
00:52:02,326 --> 00:52:03,831
Speaker 1: The universe out there becomes more

940
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:04,594
Speaker 1: conscious through us.

941
00:52:06,327 --> 00:52:07,632
Speaker 1: That's a very important principle.

942
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:08,828
Speaker 1: It's something very important to understand

943
00:52:08,868 --> 00:52:12,085
Speaker 1: in evolutionary enlightenment, in

944
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:13,289
Speaker 1: evolutionary metaphysics.

945
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:17,505
Speaker 1: As I understand it, this changes everything.

946
00:52:17,685 --> 00:52:18,388
Speaker 1: It's changed everything.

947
00:52:18,429 --> 00:52:20,912
Speaker 1: For me, it's evolutionary non-duality.

948
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,888
Speaker 1: It's when you come to recognize that

949
00:52:28,172 --> 00:52:34,620
Speaker 1: interiority exists as an inherent fact in

950
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,981
Speaker 1: the cosmos and in nature.

951
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:43,576
Speaker 1: But as the universe evolves through life

952
00:52:43,676 --> 00:52:46,690
Speaker 1: and the complexification of life, life and

953
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:48,194
Speaker 1: the complexification of life, the capacity

954
00:52:48,295 --> 00:52:51,147
Speaker 1: for the interior, the interiority of the

955
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,814
Speaker 1: cosmos grows and deepens and complexifies.

956
00:52:55,107 --> 00:52:56,532
Speaker 1: And when you experience the spiritual

957
00:52:56,572 --> 00:52:58,190
Speaker 1: impulse which is the urge to become

958
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:00,350
Speaker 1: conscious, vibrating and pulsating within

959
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:02,920
Speaker 1: your own self, that's when you realize the

960
00:53:03,001 --> 00:53:04,390
Speaker 1: universe is trying to become more conscious

961
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:04,772
Speaker 1: through you.

962
00:53:05,646 --> 00:53:06,190
Speaker 1: So let that hit you.

963
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:07,076
Speaker 1: The the universe is trying to become more

964
00:53:07,096 --> 00:53:07,579
Speaker 1: conscious through you.

965
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:08,465
Speaker 1: So let that hit you.

966
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:10,431
Speaker 1: The universe is really trying to become

967
00:53:10,451 --> 00:53:11,314
Speaker 1: more conscious through you.

968
00:53:14,126 --> 00:53:17,700
Speaker 1: And at that level of evolutionary

969
00:53:18,543 --> 00:53:19,005
Speaker 1: development.

970
00:53:19,808 --> 00:53:24,594
Speaker 1: When you understand that, you know why

971
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:25,035
Speaker 1: you're here.

972
00:53:28,146 --> 00:53:29,612
Speaker 1: And it's not about your personal life.

973
00:53:32,006 --> 00:53:35,328
Speaker 1: This is not a personal journey, by the way.

974
00:53:35,709 --> 00:53:36,191
Speaker 1: Thank God.

975
00:53:36,251 --> 00:53:37,275
Speaker 1: This is not a personal journey.

976
00:53:38,205 --> 00:53:39,550
Speaker 1: If it was, it really would be only a

977
00:53:39,611 --> 00:53:40,795
Speaker 1: nightmare, wouldn't it?

978
00:53:43,509 --> 00:53:44,966
Speaker 1: So when you realize all these things, you

979
00:53:44,986 --> 00:53:47,545
Speaker 1: wake up from the nightmare of the personal

980
00:53:49,011 --> 00:53:53,972
Speaker 1: life and you realize the cosmos is in fact

981
00:53:54,353 --> 00:53:57,919
Speaker 1: alive and awake to itself and that you and

982
00:53:58,019 --> 00:54:00,187
Speaker 1: me and I, and all of us individually,

983
00:54:00,227 --> 00:54:01,951
Speaker 1: collectively, all have a role to play.

984
00:54:02,813 --> 00:54:06,400
Speaker 1: If we make ourselves available and the

985
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,464
Speaker 1: profundity of the experience of

986
00:54:08,504 --> 00:54:12,054
Speaker 1: consciousness and of being alive is

987
00:54:12,134 --> 00:54:14,952
Speaker 1: realized to the degree to which we

988
00:54:14,972 --> 00:54:15,674
Speaker 1: understand that.

989
00:54:17,987 --> 00:54:19,613
Speaker 1: This is that life is a great adventure,

990
00:54:21,328 --> 00:54:26,206
Speaker 1: full of so much unmanifest potential, and

991
00:54:26,226 --> 00:54:27,074
Speaker 1: actualizing that potential potential and

992
00:54:27,094 --> 00:54:29,494
Speaker 1: actualizing that potential and consciously

993
00:54:30,138 --> 00:54:31,507
Speaker 1: actualizing that potential is what this

994
00:54:31,547 --> 00:54:32,271
Speaker 1: life is all about.

995
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:36,246
Speaker 1: So living on the edge of evolution means

996
00:54:36,267 --> 00:54:39,273
Speaker 1: that you get that, you get it in your soul

997
00:54:42,233 --> 00:54:43,897
Speaker 1: and you do whatever you need to do to do it.

998
00:54:45,386 --> 00:54:46,812
Speaker 1: That's what living a spiritual life is all

999
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:48,511
Speaker 1: about in an evolutionary context.

1000
00:54:52,508 --> 00:54:54,514
Speaker 1: Now, if you choose to live the spiritual

1001
00:54:54,554 --> 00:54:58,990
Speaker 1: life in earnest and if that would mean to

1002
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:03,693
Speaker 1: you living on the edge of evolution, it'll

1003
00:55:03,713 --> 00:55:05,105
Speaker 1: have a big effect on the life you're living.

1004
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:06,107
Speaker 1: It'll have a big effect on the life you're

1005
00:55:06,127 --> 00:55:11,878
Speaker 1: living Because if that's something you

1006
00:55:11,898 --> 00:55:17,377
Speaker 1: choose to do, you'll find you can't live

1007
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:22,816
Speaker 1: your life in the old way anymore, because

1008
00:55:23,157 --> 00:55:28,634
Speaker 1: the edge of evolution is a real edge and as

1009
00:55:28,734 --> 00:55:33,164
Speaker 1: and living on the edge of evolutionary

1010
00:55:33,184 --> 00:55:34,749
Speaker 1: potential is very different than not living

1011
00:55:34,809 --> 00:55:35,211
Speaker 1: on the edge.

1012
00:55:35,512 --> 00:55:36,314
Speaker 1: Let's put it that way.

1013
00:55:47,607 --> 00:55:49,751
Speaker 1: So, even though I'm speaking in a way

1014
00:55:49,771 --> 00:55:56,487
Speaker 1: that's using a lot of abstractions, what

1015
00:55:56,507 --> 00:55:59,837
Speaker 1: I'm saying also practically has profound

1016
00:56:01,161 --> 00:56:02,946
Speaker 1: emotional and psychological and practical

1017
00:56:02,986 --> 00:56:06,795
Speaker 1: implications for the way we express and

1018
00:56:06,815 --> 00:56:08,338
Speaker 1: manifest the life we're living.

1019
00:56:18,465 --> 00:56:20,131
Speaker 1: And the more courage you have, the more

1020
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:26,612
Speaker 1: courage one has to walk closer, sorry, the

1021
00:56:26,652 --> 00:56:27,995
Speaker 1: more courage one has to walk a little

1022
00:56:28,015 --> 00:56:31,991
Speaker 1: farther out on that ledge, the more

1023
00:56:32,051 --> 00:56:33,315
Speaker 1: thrilling is the ride.

1024
00:56:35,126 --> 00:56:38,232
Speaker 1: But it doesn't mean that it's not easy, for

1025
00:56:38,293 --> 00:56:38,954
Speaker 1: obvious reasons.

1026
00:56:40,618 --> 00:56:43,065
Speaker 1: Very good, so I think I'm going to shut up

1027
00:56:43,145 --> 00:56:43,265
Speaker 1: now.
