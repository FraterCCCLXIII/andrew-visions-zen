1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,304
Speaker 1: Normally, when we think about idealism, or

2
00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:08,346
Speaker 1: what we could call utopian idealism, make

3
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:09,226
Speaker 1: it even more extreme.

4
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:16,191
Speaker 1: The idea of utopian idealism, or even the

5
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:20,574
Speaker 1: idea of utopia itself, is usually by very

6
00:00:20,614 --> 00:00:24,056
Speaker 1: sophisticated, intelligent, philosophically

7
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:26,238
Speaker 1: oriented people, is often considered to be

8
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:30,271
Speaker 1: a non-rational, dangerous idea.

9
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:35,445
Speaker 1: So I'd like to speak about this

10
00:00:36,087 --> 00:00:39,394
Speaker 1: non-rational, dangerous idea a little bit

11
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:42,903
Speaker 1: and let's see where we go with it.

12
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,217
Speaker 1: The interesting thing about enlightenment,

13
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:00,320
Speaker 1: the evolution of consciousness, the

14
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,063
Speaker 1: experience of higher states of

15
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:02,046
Speaker 1: consciousness that awakened us to

16
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:05,385
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness, is that they reveal

17
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:10,263
Speaker 1: to us transrational truths about the nature

18
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:16,169
Speaker 1: of reality, that there are certain

19
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,704
Speaker 1: perspectives that we can glimpse in these

20
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,462
Speaker 1: higher states that we can directly

21
00:01:19,502 --> 00:01:22,641
Speaker 1: experience that are definitely not rational

22
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:24,788
Speaker 1: at all.

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,004
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, they can seem from a

24
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:35,440
Speaker 1: rational perspective as being very crazy.

25
00:01:37,082 --> 00:01:38,425
Speaker 1: So I'd just like to start at the beginning

26
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:42,281
Speaker 1: and say that the higher truth, the higher

27
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:45,727
Speaker 1: truths that bestow upon us a glimpse of

28
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:48,733
Speaker 1: spiritual liberation and enlightened

29
00:01:48,773 --> 00:01:52,546
Speaker 1: awareness, definitely transcend the

30
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:54,251
Speaker 1: category of anything we could call rational,

31
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,422
Speaker 1: and that's kind of the basis of what I want

32
00:01:58,442 --> 00:01:59,022
Speaker 1: to speak about.

33
00:02:05,788 --> 00:02:09,171
Speaker 1: I remember when I started on the path about

34
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:13,515
Speaker 1: 35 years ago, like many people, I was doing

35
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,917
Speaker 1: a lot of Buddhist meditation retreats,

36
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:23,684
Speaker 1: vipassana retreats, which many of us got

37
00:02:23,704 --> 00:02:24,646
Speaker 1: trained in along the way, and I remember

38
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:33,179
Speaker 1: that my first spiritual teacher enlightened

39
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,201
Speaker 1: spiritual teachers, if they're

40
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:35,806
Speaker 1: authentically enlightened and authentically

41
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:41,247
Speaker 1: awake, have a capacity to convey a level of

42
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:43,574
Speaker 1: inspiration about our own potential.

43
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,459
Speaker 1: We're evolving at the level of

44
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,903
Speaker 1: consciousness and our own potential to

45
00:02:46,943 --> 00:02:49,231
Speaker 1: glimpse enlightened states of awareness.

46
00:02:51,783 --> 00:02:54,351
Speaker 1: If you see someone, spend time with someone,

47
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,885
Speaker 1: spend time in the presence of the company

48
00:02:56,925 --> 00:03:01,347
Speaker 1: of someone who has access to these what I

49
00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:02,850
Speaker 1: would call miraculous higher states of

50
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,635
Speaker 1: consciousness, those such individuals can

51
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:06,657
Speaker 1: convey to us and transmit to us what I

52
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:07,659
Speaker 1: would call miraculous higher states of

53
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:08,080
Speaker 1: consciousness.

54
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:11,124
Speaker 1: Those such individuals can convey to us and

55
00:03:11,144 --> 00:03:16,933
Speaker 1: transmit to us or embody for us a higher

56
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:18,495
Speaker 1: potential for ourself.

57
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:22,720
Speaker 1: So I remember my first spiritual teacher

58
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:29,674
Speaker 1: was an Indian guru who died a long time ago.

59
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,221
Speaker 1: His name was Swami Hariharanandagiri and he

60
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:35,387
Speaker 1: was in the lineage of Kriya Yoga with

61
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,144
Speaker 1: Paramahansa, yogananda and his guru, sri

62
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:52,171
Speaker 1: Yukteswar, and I never met anybody like

63
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,679
Speaker 1: that before because he was always smiling

64
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,323
Speaker 1: and he wasn't a great speaker.

65
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:55,869
Speaker 1: He didn't give very good talks because his

66
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,722
Speaker 1: English and his rational faculty sometimes

67
00:03:58,742 --> 00:04:00,387
Speaker 1: seemed a little incoherent, speaking of

68
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:00,949
Speaker 1: being rational.

69
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,762
Speaker 1: So his talks were.

70
00:04:02,963 --> 00:04:06,732
Speaker 1: I found them quite incoherent and difficult

71
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:07,173
Speaker 1: to follow.

72
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:12,949
Speaker 1: But when he would laugh and he would giggle

73
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:13,731
Speaker 1: and he would smile.

74
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:19,954
Speaker 1: He would radiate the knowledge of a higher

75
00:04:19,974 --> 00:04:21,784
Speaker 1: dimension of reality that I was desperate

76
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:23,763
Speaker 1: to gain access to, and he was very

77
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:24,587
Speaker 1: consistent in that.

78
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:27,724
Speaker 1: And he would do things like say he would

79
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:30,692
Speaker 1: say, my mango is very sweet.

80
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:40,234
Speaker 1: And he would often speak with unrestricted

81
00:04:40,294 --> 00:04:43,080
Speaker 1: passion about his experience of higher

82
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,614
Speaker 1: states of consciousness and about how

83
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:47,618
Speaker 1: profound, how powerful, how extraordinary,

84
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:49,772
Speaker 1: how miraculous, how liberating they were

85
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:52,953
Speaker 1: and how this had changed his life and was

86
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:54,000
Speaker 1: continuing to change his life.

87
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,249
Speaker 1: And he spoke with such a sense of authority

88
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,523
Speaker 1: and honesty and integrity about these

89
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,990
Speaker 1: experiences that there was no doubt that he

90
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,323
Speaker 1: was speaking honestly about what was his

91
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:04,728
Speaker 1: own direct experience and honesty and

92
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:05,387
Speaker 1: integrity about these experiences that

93
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:05,606
Speaker 1: there was no doubt that he was speaking

94
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:08,105
Speaker 1: honestly about what was his own direct

95
00:05:08,145 --> 00:05:08,707
Speaker 1: experience.

96
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:11,761
Speaker 1: And it was clear that his experience was

97
00:05:11,781 --> 00:05:12,746
Speaker 1: very different than ours.

98
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:15,755
Speaker 1: He was living in a different plane of

99
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,344
Speaker 1: consciousness and his relationship to

100
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,647
Speaker 1: reality was very different because he had

101
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:23,963
Speaker 1: access to the entire states, and his access

102
00:05:23,983 --> 00:05:25,047
Speaker 1: to those higher states made all the

103
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:25,448
Speaker 1: difference.

104
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:37,875
Speaker 1: So while I found in many ways his his, his

105
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:39,426
Speaker 1: I told you just to repeat when he gave

106
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:42,067
Speaker 1: talks, I found him quite incoherent when it

107
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,727
Speaker 1: came to being rational in terms of giving a

108
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:45,068
Speaker 1: talk.

109
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:52,437
Speaker 1: But beyond that, he conveyed the truth of

110
00:05:52,457 --> 00:05:53,740
Speaker 1: the enlightenment that he was trying to

111
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,045
Speaker 1: share with us, trying to transmit to us and

112
00:05:56,065 --> 00:06:00,034
Speaker 1: was so earnestly bearing witness to.

113
00:06:01,381 --> 00:06:03,689
Speaker 1: So his example had a big effect on me.

114
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:08,318
Speaker 1: So his example had a big effect on me.

115
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,142
Speaker 1: So, around the same time I met him, a

116
00:06:13,262 --> 00:06:14,605
Speaker 1: friend of mine introduced me to Buddhism

117
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,908
Speaker 1: and to these long sitting retreats that one

118
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:18,401
Speaker 1: could go on for 10 days, 20 days, a few

119
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:20,904
Speaker 1: months at a time, and I remember I thought

120
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:22,048
Speaker 1: this was just fantastic.

121
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,327
Speaker 1: I said, wow, you can sit in this meditation

122
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:27,453
Speaker 1: hall for 16, 18, 20 hours a day if you want.

123
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:31,309
Speaker 1: And for me that was my idea of heaven at

124
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:31,650
Speaker 1: the time.

125
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:37,398
Speaker 1: But I remember this was a very different

126
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,504
Speaker 1: environment and all of the talks were very

127
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,972
Speaker 1: coherent, very rational, very consistent.

128
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:46,406
Speaker 1: They were philosophically consistent,

129
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:51,808
Speaker 1: metaphysically consistent and they created

130
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,413
Speaker 1: a metaphysical and philosophical framework

131
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,729
Speaker 1: that was very convincing and very intricate

132
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:58,532
Speaker 1: and ornate.

133
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,650
Speaker 1: But none of the teachers who were teaching

134
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,503
Speaker 1: us meditation, some of whom we've been at

135
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:09,224
Speaker 1: it for many, many, many years, conveyed

136
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:12,057
Speaker 1: anywhere near that sense of spontaneous joy

137
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:14,748
Speaker 1: and inner freedom that this Indian guru had.

138
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:18,127
Speaker 1: They knew all about enlightenment from a

139
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,281
Speaker 1: technical point of view, from a

140
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:20,726
Speaker 1: philosophical point of view and from a

141
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:23,523
Speaker 1: scriptural point of view, but none of them

142
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,429
Speaker 1: transmitted or conveyed it in the way he

143
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:27,306
Speaker 1: did so spontaneously, effortlessly and

144
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:27,788
Speaker 1: naturally.

145
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:32,142
Speaker 1: So I found this very confusing, because,

146
00:07:32,182 --> 00:07:33,767
Speaker 1: whatever enlightenment is, he definitely

147
00:07:33,807 --> 00:07:36,883
Speaker 1: found it and it had found him, whereas most

148
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:38,530
Speaker 1: of these other teachers seemed to me to be

149
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:43,353
Speaker 1: good teachers and good technicians and had

150
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:45,041
Speaker 1: a good grasp of the theory, but they didn't

151
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:47,748
Speaker 1: seem to be swimming in the altered state of

152
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:49,052
Speaker 1: consciousness that I was looking for.

153
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,809
Speaker 1: And then, finally, I met.

154
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:55,460
Speaker 1: Finally there was an English teacher who

155
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,131
Speaker 1: came to town, an English man who had been a

156
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:03,985
Speaker 1: monk for a long time, who was teaching the

157
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:05,590
Speaker 1: same practice, but he was different because

158
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,385
Speaker 1: he sometimes he would just start laughing

159
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,345
Speaker 1: spontaneously, he would hear that outburst

160
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:16,642
Speaker 1: of laughter and he would wink, and he

161
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:17,685
Speaker 1: seemed to know the secret.

162
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,507
Speaker 1: Whatever.

163
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:20,812
Speaker 1: Whatever the secret is, he was in on it.

164
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,245
Speaker 1: And he was the only teacher in that

165
00:08:23,265 --> 00:08:28,662
Speaker 1: tradition that kind of inspired me to stick

166
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:34,332
Speaker 1: with it a little bit longer, because his

167
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:40,006
Speaker 1: laugh and his wink conveyed the fact that

168
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:44,373
Speaker 1: he, that he knew something mysterious that

169
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:46,382
Speaker 1: was the source of liberation, which is what

170
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:47,105
Speaker 1: we were trying to do.

171
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:48,944
Speaker 1: That's what the whole point of meditation

172
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:50,690
Speaker 1: is all about is to find liberation.

173
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,302
Speaker 1: And he wasn't just speaking about it, but

174
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:57,284
Speaker 1: he also was transmitting it in a way that

175
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:57,966
Speaker 1: was compelling.

176
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:03,236
Speaker 1: And what people who awaken to enlightened

177
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:07,267
Speaker 1: awareness convey is transrational knowledge,

178
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,394
Speaker 1: transrational knowing, transrational gnosis,

179
00:09:13,503 --> 00:09:14,728
Speaker 1: and it's important to understand this.

180
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,550
Speaker 1: I'm not advocating excuse me that the mind

181
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:27,998
Speaker 1: is not a very important friend, very

182
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:29,584
Speaker 1: important friend, and I've always been a

183
00:09:29,604 --> 00:09:32,078
Speaker 1: great believer in a fiercely rational

184
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:35,008
Speaker 1: spirituality and I think I've been a fairly

185
00:09:35,048 --> 00:09:37,325
Speaker 1: consistent proponent and exemplar of a

186
00:09:37,345 --> 00:09:38,730
Speaker 1: rational approach to enlightenment.

187
00:09:40,602 --> 00:09:44,725
Speaker 1: So I am very much, I try to be a rational

188
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:51,448
Speaker 1: guy as much as I can, but I get the sense

189
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:53,933
Speaker 1: these days in some very sophisticated

190
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:58,287
Speaker 1: circles when it comes to higher states of

191
00:09:58,327 --> 00:09:59,570
Speaker 1: consciousness and the possibility of

192
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,693
Speaker 1: awakening to enlightened awareness.

193
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,267
Speaker 1: I think too many people are losing the plot

194
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,851
Speaker 1: aligned awareness.

195
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,119
Speaker 1: I think it's too many people losing the

196
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:12,202
Speaker 1: plot Because without getting to that point

197
00:10:12,222 --> 00:10:14,246
Speaker 1: when we actually transcend our rational

198
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:15,088
Speaker 1: faculties in a way that is radical and

199
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:16,010
Speaker 1: quite extreme, we're never going to take

200
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,674
Speaker 1: the leap beyond the mind.

201
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:20,058
Speaker 1: It's all about taking that leap beyond the

202
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:20,220
Speaker 1: mind.

203
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,548
Speaker 1: So unless we're willing to dispense with

204
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:26,993
Speaker 1: our rational faculties for a period of time,

205
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:29,984
Speaker 1: we'll never be able to glimpse what lays

206
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,769
Speaker 1: beyond the mind, and that's where the

207
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,501
Speaker 1: secret is, that's where the mystery abides.

208
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:41,770
Speaker 1: And when I finally met my guru, the great

209
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,752
Speaker 1: HWL Punjo, the disciple of Ramana Maharshi,

210
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:45,114
Speaker 1: in 1986.

211
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,362
Speaker 1: His calm, abiding in an altered state of

212
00:10:53,382 --> 00:10:54,483
Speaker 1: consciousness beyond the mind, was

213
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:55,325
Speaker 1: absolutely amazing.

214
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:56,366
Speaker 1: And he spoke about enlightenment, or

215
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,411
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness, with a sense of

216
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:02,395
Speaker 1: immediacy that I found quite shocking.

217
00:11:10,745 --> 00:11:13,772
Speaker 1: When I met him, he started taking my own

218
00:11:13,813 --> 00:11:16,600
Speaker 1: potential for enlightenment more seriously

219
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,445
Speaker 1: than I was and I was a pretty serious guy,

220
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:19,187
Speaker 1: still am.

221
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:22,282
Speaker 1: But I never met somebody who seemed to be

222
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:25,120
Speaker 1: so acquainted with enlightenment from

223
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,106
Speaker 1: direct experience and he spoke about it so,

224
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,022
Speaker 1: like my first group, he spoke about it so

225
00:11:31,062 --> 00:11:34,679
Speaker 1: passionately and so directly from what

226
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:35,923
Speaker 1: seemed to be the immediacy of his own

227
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:36,485
Speaker 1: experience.

228
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:39,822
Speaker 1: Enlightenment for him was not far away, it

229
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:42,520
Speaker 1: was here and now and he was transmitting it,

230
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,119
Speaker 1: he was radiating it and the strangest

231
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,103
Speaker 1: things would happen around him.

232
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,639
Speaker 1: One day I was sitting with him in his

233
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:56,028
Speaker 1: living room and a rather ordinary older

234
00:11:56,108 --> 00:11:57,017
Speaker 1: Indian woman came in.

235
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:00,827
Speaker 1: She didn't look remarkable in any way and

236
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:05,106
Speaker 1: he said ask her about her experience, she's

237
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:05,587
Speaker 1: enlightened.

238
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:08,345
Speaker 1: And I said, and I thought he must be crazy.

239
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:09,096
Speaker 1: I didn't know where.

240
00:12:09,136 --> 00:12:10,581
Speaker 1: I thought she said she sounded absurd and

241
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:11,083
Speaker 1: ridiculous.

242
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:13,241
Speaker 1: He said no, no, andrew, go and speak to her,

243
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:14,305
Speaker 1: ask her about her experience.

244
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:18,864
Speaker 1: So I can't remember the question I asked

245
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:19,959
Speaker 1: her, but I asked her some questions about

246
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,279
Speaker 1: meditation and, without missing a beat,

247
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:26,167
Speaker 1: without hesitating, he said oh, that's good

248
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:26,655
Speaker 1: for beginners.

249
00:12:27,157 --> 00:12:29,003
Speaker 1: And she said it with a totally straight

250
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:32,902
Speaker 1: face and she responded quicker, quicker,

251
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:33,829
Speaker 1: the faster than thought.

252
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:34,655
Speaker 1: She said oh, that's good for beginners.

253
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:36,536
Speaker 1: So her spiritual self-confidence, in terms

254
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:38,016
Speaker 1: of awakening to enlightened awareness was

255
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:39,863
Speaker 1: unparalleled and something I'd never seen.

256
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:41,040
Speaker 1: I'd never seen this before.

257
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:44,502
Speaker 1: I'd never met people who had this kind of,

258
00:12:44,595 --> 00:12:47,416
Speaker 1: I'd never met so many people, in such a

259
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:48,656
Speaker 1: short period of time, who seemed to have

260
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:49,941
Speaker 1: access to enlightened awareness.

261
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:57,754
Speaker 1: This made a very powerful impression on me.

262
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:21,632
Speaker 1: So so If the goal is to gain spiritual

263
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:23,359
Speaker 1: self-confidence, if the goal is to awaken

264
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,517
Speaker 1: to enlightened awareness, then we've got to

265
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:27,324
Speaker 1: do whatever we need to do to gain access,

266
00:13:27,716 --> 00:13:37,010
Speaker 1: to succeed in our endeavor to awaken, to

267
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,593
Speaker 1: gain access, to succeed in our endeavor to

268
00:13:38,613 --> 00:13:38,734
Speaker 1: awaken.

269
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,947
Speaker 1: I personally feel very passionately that if

270
00:13:43,918 --> 00:13:44,977
Speaker 1: enlightenment is what we're compelled by

271
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:46,049
Speaker 1: the promise of enlightenment, the potential

272
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:52,246
Speaker 1: for enlightenment, then we've got to give

273
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:52,968
Speaker 1: it everything we've got.

274
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:54,080
Speaker 1: We've got to do anything and everything we

275
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,570
Speaker 1: can to have these experiences of higher

276
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,219
Speaker 1: states of consciousness that blow our mind

277
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:01,677
Speaker 1: and blow our heart wide open, and I think

278
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:04,740
Speaker 1: we need to stop pretending that that is not

279
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,225
Speaker 1: the most important thing, because it is

280
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:12,095
Speaker 1: being utterly knocked over and overwhelmed

281
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:14,555
Speaker 1: by the potential of consciousness.

282
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,280
Speaker 1: To reveal the ultimate truth about the

283
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:19,100
Speaker 1: nature of reality is what this is all about

284
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:21,035
Speaker 1: and what it's always been about and what

285
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:22,097
Speaker 1: it's always going to be about.

286
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:29,970
Speaker 1: Psychotherapy can help us to clean up our

287
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,857
Speaker 1: act, but it won't help to liberate us, not

288
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:32,300
Speaker 1: in the end.

289
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:40,048
Speaker 1: And the thing about higher states is

290
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:42,180
Speaker 1: they're very elusive, they're very

291
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:42,803
Speaker 1: mysterious.

292
00:14:45,627 --> 00:14:47,555
Speaker 1: They can be here one day and gone tomorrow.

293
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:52,138
Speaker 1: And one of the most mysterious things about

294
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,898
Speaker 1: higher states of consciousness I've come to

295
00:14:54,581 --> 00:15:00,783
Speaker 1: find from the perspective of teaching is

296
00:15:00,843 --> 00:15:03,479
Speaker 1: that I've seen over the years, countless

297
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,856
Speaker 1: people wake up to these higher states and,

298
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:07,961
Speaker 1: when they're in these higher states,

299
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:11,211
Speaker 1: glimpse the ultimate or absolute nature of

300
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,660
Speaker 1: reality and, as a result, become absolutely

301
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,346
Speaker 1: illuminated or lit up by the fire of

302
00:15:16,426 --> 00:15:17,876
Speaker 1: consciousness and the knowing of

303
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:21,665
Speaker 1: consciousness, the knowing of non-duality

304
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:23,536
Speaker 1: from their own inner experience, from their

305
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,498
Speaker 1: own direct experience, and that, as we know,

306
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:29,386
Speaker 1: at least temporarily, changes everything.

307
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:33,923
Speaker 1: When you directly experience the non-dual

308
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:35,207
Speaker 1: or absolute nature of reality.

309
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:37,500
Speaker 1: Your mind is thrown out the window and you

310
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,924
Speaker 1: begin to see reality through a different

311
00:15:38,984 --> 00:15:39,345
Speaker 1: lens.

312
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,682
Speaker 1: And that different lens changes everything

313
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:48,143
Speaker 1: because there is inherent in the vision of

314
00:15:48,203 --> 00:15:49,907
Speaker 1: non-duality and the direct experience of

315
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:50,548
Speaker 1: non-duality.

316
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:54,722
Speaker 1: Non-duality is not just the conscious

317
00:15:54,762 --> 00:15:57,827
Speaker 1: perception or conscious cognition of a

318
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:01,722
Speaker 1: great singularity of all is one and one is

319
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:03,206
Speaker 1: all, as you all have heard about.

320
00:16:04,515 --> 00:16:05,257
Speaker 1: That's part of it.

321
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:08,643
Speaker 1: Experiencing the inherent non-dual

322
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:11,268
Speaker 1: singularity that is all of reality is a

323
00:16:11,328 --> 00:16:11,689
Speaker 1: part of it.

324
00:16:12,215 --> 00:16:13,160
Speaker 1: It's an important part of it.

325
00:16:15,295 --> 00:16:17,500
Speaker 1: But I think what's more important is that

326
00:16:18,784 --> 00:16:20,595
Speaker 1: in the radiance of the non-dual vision, in

327
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:24,375
Speaker 1: the radiance of the non-dual experience, in

328
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:28,616
Speaker 1: the radiance of the non-dual knowing, there

329
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:33,175
Speaker 1: is a direct gnosis of a indescribable and

330
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:34,641
Speaker 1: overwhelming pure positivity.

331
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:38,220
Speaker 1: But it's a pure positivity that is

332
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:41,899
Speaker 1: transrational and non-relative.

333
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:50,995
Speaker 1: Non-relative means the totality of reality

334
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:54,641
Speaker 1: falls into two categories.

335
00:16:54,661 --> 00:16:57,356
Speaker 1: According to Mahayana Buddhism, there's a

336
00:16:57,377 --> 00:16:58,901
Speaker 1: distinction between what's called relative

337
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:00,346
Speaker 1: reality and absolute reality.

338
00:17:02,617 --> 00:17:04,222
Speaker 1: Relative reality and absolute reality are

339
00:17:04,242 --> 00:17:06,681
Speaker 1: two different dimensions of cognition, of

340
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:09,513
Speaker 1: perception and of existence and

341
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:14,949
Speaker 1: manifestation, of perception and of

342
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:16,955
Speaker 1: existence and manifestation.

343
00:17:19,235 --> 00:17:20,117
Speaker 1: So relative reality is the place where the

344
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:21,541
Speaker 1: unenlightened mind and unenlightened

345
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:23,767
Speaker 1: consciousness and cognition predominate.

346
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:34,953
Speaker 1: Manifest reality, manifest reality,

347
00:17:36,815 --> 00:17:39,763
Speaker 1: so-called normal state of consciousness.

348
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:41,547
Speaker 1: But when we awaken to absolute reality,

349
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:47,693
Speaker 1: this non-relative dimension of

350
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:48,054
Speaker 1: consciousness.

351
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:52,365
Speaker 1: It's a flip from one dimension to another.

352
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:53,829
Speaker 1: And in this definitely higher dimension

353
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:58,743
Speaker 1: there is the unequivocal, undoubted

354
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:03,385
Speaker 1: recognition in this higher state, that what

355
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:05,132
Speaker 1: one is experiencing, or the way one is

356
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:07,122
Speaker 1: seeing and feeling and knowing reality in

357
00:18:07,142 --> 00:18:10,177
Speaker 1: that higher state that is non-relative, is

358
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:12,443
Speaker 1: that this non-relative perception is

359
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:13,647
Speaker 1: inherently more real.

360
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:16,735
Speaker 1: And everybody who makes this slip says oh

361
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:19,585
Speaker 1: my goodness, in this state of consciousness

362
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:22,200
Speaker 1: I'm experiencing reality with much more

363
00:18:23,022 --> 00:18:24,606
Speaker 1: depth and authenticity.

364
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,328
Speaker 1: This is real.

365
00:18:26,176 --> 00:18:27,782
Speaker 1: In comparison to this state of

366
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:30,580
Speaker 1: consciousness, relative reality is seen to

367
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,684
Speaker 1: be unreal.

368
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:35,261
Speaker 1: But in this higher state of non-relative

369
00:18:36,143 --> 00:18:38,417
Speaker 1: perception, consciousness and cognition,

370
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:40,543
Speaker 1: I'm experiencing reality as being

371
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:41,546
Speaker 1: infinitely more real.

372
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:43,740
Speaker 1: This is real.

373
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:46,353
Speaker 1: And in comparison to this absolute

374
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:49,142
Speaker 1: perception of greater reality, relative

375
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,867
Speaker 1: reality is seen and felt as being unreal.

376
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:54,235
Speaker 1: And this is a very important distinction,

377
00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:57,951
Speaker 1: because if it's true and it is true, but

378
00:18:57,991 --> 00:18:59,276
Speaker 1: you have to have the experience to know

379
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:02,124
Speaker 1: that it's true would you want to live in a

380
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:04,142
Speaker 1: relationship to reality that's

381
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:06,473
Speaker 1: fundamentally recognized to be unreal and

382
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:09,282
Speaker 1: false and partial, or would you want to

383
00:19:09,342 --> 00:19:12,178
Speaker 1: have a relationship to reality that is real

384
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:18,475
Speaker 1: and absolute and intoxicating?

385
00:19:22,717 --> 00:19:24,481
Speaker 1: So the point I wanted to make was that

386
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:31,443
Speaker 1: inherent in the non-dual vision is the

387
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:34,400
Speaker 1: direct perception, the direct gnosis or

388
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,895
Speaker 1: cognition of pure positivity.

389
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:43,313
Speaker 1: That inherent in this ultimate or absolute

390
00:19:43,353 --> 00:19:47,483
Speaker 1: perspective is a knowledge or a knowing of

391
00:19:47,543 --> 00:19:51,521
Speaker 1: reality itself in its essence that is

392
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:54,437
Speaker 1: indescribably positive, overwhelmingly

393
00:19:54,477 --> 00:19:56,144
Speaker 1: positive and conceivably positive.

394
00:19:58,478 --> 00:20:00,324
Speaker 1: It's a recognition that the very essence of

395
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:04,882
Speaker 1: reality, which is not a thing, the very

396
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:06,607
Speaker 1: essence of the very heart of reality itself,

397
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,801
Speaker 1: in the very essence or in the very heart of

398
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:11,541
Speaker 1: reality itself, is a pure positivity.

399
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:15,457
Speaker 1: It's absolutely undefiled by anything that

400
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:16,381
Speaker 1: the mind can come up with.

401
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,361
Speaker 1: It's what happens when you see the face of

402
00:20:21,401 --> 00:20:21,683
Speaker 1: God.

403
00:20:23,998 --> 00:20:26,215
Speaker 1: You recognize a purity and a perfection

404
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:28,664
Speaker 1: that is mind-boggling, awe-inspiring.

405
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:29,881
Speaker 1: That's what brings us to our knees.

406
00:20:33,497 --> 00:20:35,391
Speaker 1: It's the direct cognition of this pure

407
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:37,221
Speaker 1: positivity that's so life-transforming.

408
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,377
Speaker 1: And we know this is very important because

409
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:45,456
Speaker 1: smart, sensitive, thoughtful people want to

410
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:49,467
Speaker 1: know is existence a good thing?

411
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,621
Speaker 1: When something came from nothing, was it a

412
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:52,304
Speaker 1: big yes, was it a from nothing?

413
00:20:52,344 --> 00:20:53,710
Speaker 1: Was it a big yes, was it a big no?

414
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,875
Speaker 1: Was it a big neutral?

415
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:56,541
Speaker 1: Is life inherently good or is life

416
00:20:56,581 --> 00:20:59,219
Speaker 1: inherently a bad trip, as most people seem

417
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:00,043
Speaker 1: to feel that it is?

418
00:21:02,117 --> 00:21:03,609
Speaker 1: And we have to take this seriously because

419
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:05,178
Speaker 1: a lot of the smartest, most sensitive,

420
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:08,834
Speaker 1: thoughtful people haven't had the kind of

421
00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:10,280
Speaker 1: awakening I'm describing to you and are

422
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,850
Speaker 1: therefore not so sure that life is

423
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,558
Speaker 1: inherently a good thing, because there's so

424
00:21:14,598 --> 00:21:17,521
Speaker 1: much suffering, so much confusion, so much

425
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:23,002
Speaker 1: fear, so much doubt, so much depression,

426
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:26,089
Speaker 1: anxiety, self-concern, terror.

427
00:21:31,636 --> 00:21:33,988
Speaker 1: So when we make this leap from relative

428
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:35,677
Speaker 1: reality to absolute reality, and in this

429
00:21:35,717 --> 00:21:38,275
Speaker 1: leap from absolute reality we glimpse, we

430
00:21:38,315 --> 00:21:41,865
Speaker 1: have a direct cognosis or cognition of the

431
00:21:41,905 --> 00:21:44,781
Speaker 1: fact that inherent in the ultimate nature

432
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:46,406
Speaker 1: of reality is a pure positivity.

433
00:21:46,795 --> 00:21:48,501
Speaker 1: Inherent in the ultimate nature of reality

434
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:51,438
Speaker 1: is a pure positivity, a pure positivity,

435
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:54,796
Speaker 1: that is its nature, is purely positive, the

436
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,061
Speaker 1: essence of reality itself.

437
00:21:58,618 --> 00:21:59,462
Speaker 1: Don't take my word for it.

438
00:21:59,515 --> 00:22:02,283
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, if you have the experience,

439
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:03,246
Speaker 1: you'll see that it's true.

440
00:22:05,475 --> 00:22:10,948
Speaker 1: That's why people who are truly enlightened

441
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,442
Speaker 1: which means they have access to these

442
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:19,048
Speaker 1: higher states on a regular basis when you

443
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:20,433
Speaker 1: go deep enough into these experiences of

444
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:22,062
Speaker 1: higher states, it changes you.

445
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:25,425
Speaker 1: It changes you at a level of the soul,

446
00:22:29,144 --> 00:22:33,222
Speaker 1: because you know this absolute truth beyond

447
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:35,599
Speaker 1: the mind, by the way, beyond the rational

448
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:35,840
Speaker 1: mind.

449
00:22:38,597 --> 00:22:39,641
Speaker 1: And you know that it's true.

450
00:22:41,258 --> 00:22:42,682
Speaker 1: Even if the whole world is going to hell,

451
00:22:42,702 --> 00:22:45,580
Speaker 1: with everyone in it, it doesn't change the

452
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,403
Speaker 1: absolute truth.

453
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:50,616
Speaker 1: And if you know that, it gives you

454
00:22:50,656 --> 00:22:54,286
Speaker 1: spiritual self-confidenceconfidence, even

455
00:22:54,326 --> 00:22:58,643
Speaker 1: if you're on the titanic, it's not that you

456
00:22:58,683 --> 00:22:59,104
Speaker 1: don't care.

457
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,868
Speaker 1: You do care, but you know that whatever is

458
00:23:00,888 --> 00:23:03,259
Speaker 1: going to happen on that ship won't

459
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,125
Speaker 1: ultimately change the highest and deepest

460
00:23:06,145 --> 00:23:08,237
Speaker 1: truth about the ultimate nature of reality,

461
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:11,473
Speaker 1: which is that inherent in this mysterious

462
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:15,984
Speaker 1: process called existence, inherent at the

463
00:23:16,044 --> 00:23:22,541
Speaker 1: very core level of existence, is a pure

464
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:24,445
Speaker 1: positivity that's indescribable and,

465
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:26,549
Speaker 1: ultimately, completely overwhelming.

466
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:39,939
Speaker 1: So so there's this distinction between

467
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,981
Speaker 1: relative reality and absolute reality, and

468
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,312
Speaker 1: we get these glimpses of this pure

469
00:23:45,352 --> 00:23:48,055
Speaker 1: positivity indescribable pure positivity

470
00:23:49,098 --> 00:23:50,582
Speaker 1: when we awaken to the non-relative,

471
00:23:51,103 --> 00:23:59,183
Speaker 1: absolute dimension of reality, and you know,

472
00:23:59,283 --> 00:24:00,806
Speaker 1: as a higher, as an experience of a higher

473
00:24:00,826 --> 00:24:01,648
Speaker 1: state of consciousness.

474
00:24:03,076 --> 00:24:04,982
Speaker 1: Now, what we'll notice is that most of the

475
00:24:05,022 --> 00:24:09,639
Speaker 1: great realizers not only had a profound

476
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,926
Speaker 1: awakening to non-relative absolute reality,

477
00:24:12,855 --> 00:24:14,595
Speaker 1: but their awakening was usually so deep, so

478
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:16,221
Speaker 1: profound, so life-transforming, so

479
00:24:16,282 --> 00:24:19,179
Speaker 1: mesmerizing, that they came back from these

480
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:22,417
Speaker 1: higher states with a great vision, a vision

481
00:24:22,457 --> 00:24:24,620
Speaker 1: of the possible, a vision of heaven on

482
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,724
Speaker 1: earth, a vision of utopia.

483
00:24:29,758 --> 00:24:31,170
Speaker 1: The experience of these higher states of

484
00:24:31,211 --> 00:24:40,444
Speaker 1: consciousness inspire most realizers to try

485
00:24:40,504 --> 00:24:45,238
Speaker 1: to bring this vision of perfection, this

486
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,977
Speaker 1: experience of perfection, to try to bring

487
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:50,727
Speaker 1: it into manifest relative reality.

488
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:53,282
Speaker 1: This is when things get tricky and you just

489
00:24:53,302 --> 00:24:53,763
Speaker 1: go wrong.

490
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:57,466
Speaker 1: Go wrong, but before we get there, I just

491
00:24:57,486 --> 00:25:00,985
Speaker 1: want to make this point that the deepest

492
00:25:01,046 --> 00:25:02,473
Speaker 1: and most profoundly life-changing

493
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:03,677
Speaker 1: experiences of higher states of

494
00:25:03,717 --> 00:25:05,864
Speaker 1: consciousness almost always not in every

495
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:09,661
Speaker 1: case, but almost always inspire the

496
00:25:09,701 --> 00:25:13,288
Speaker 1: realizer to want to transform relative

497
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:15,520
Speaker 1: reality, the world of time and space, self

498
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,116
Speaker 1: and other world and culture, to want to

499
00:25:19,136 --> 00:25:21,243
Speaker 1: transcend the relative world, relative

500
00:25:21,283 --> 00:25:28,123
Speaker 1: reality, into a vision of absolute reality.

501
00:25:28,584 --> 00:25:31,817
Speaker 1: Which means I've been to heaven, I've seen

502
00:25:31,857 --> 00:25:33,944
Speaker 1: heaven, heaven is real, heaven exists.

503
00:25:35,296 --> 00:25:36,621
Speaker 1: And now I want to try and create heaven on

504
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:36,862
Speaker 1: earth.

505
00:25:38,576 --> 00:25:39,802
Speaker 1: It's called the utopian vision.

506
00:25:43,698 --> 00:25:45,063
Speaker 1: In Mahayana Buddhism they call it the land

507
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:45,665
Speaker 1: of Shambhala.

508
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,596
Speaker 1: So it seems that in most cases that

509
00:25:53,077 --> 00:25:55,063
Speaker 1: inherent in the profound spiritual

510
00:25:55,103 --> 00:26:06,024
Speaker 1: realization is the inspired compulsion to

511
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,440
Speaker 1: try and create this heavenly realm, to turn

512
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:11,217
Speaker 1: this heavenly realm that we experience as a

513
00:26:11,258 --> 00:26:13,419
Speaker 1: spiritual state or as a vision.

514
00:26:14,382 --> 00:26:17,484
Speaker 1: We want to try and transform the relative

515
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:21,519
Speaker 1: world into that vision, to make that vision

516
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,786
Speaker 1: come alive and manifest reality.

517
00:26:25,498 --> 00:26:27,853
Speaker 1: And that's what all spiritual groups and

518
00:26:27,873 --> 00:26:30,018
Speaker 1: spiritual cults throughout history have

519
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:30,559
Speaker 1: tried to do.

520
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:33,986
Speaker 1: They wanted to come together, awaken to

521
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:36,215
Speaker 1: these higher states of consciousness, have

522
00:26:36,235 --> 00:26:38,021
Speaker 1: the spiritual vision and try to actualize

523
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:42,859
Speaker 1: it in this world, more often than not

524
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:43,683
Speaker 1: failing miserably.

525
00:26:49,424 --> 00:26:50,807
Speaker 1: But I want you just to get an idea of how

526
00:26:50,827 --> 00:26:51,368
Speaker 1: this works.

527
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:54,208
Speaker 1: But I want you just to get an idea of how

528
00:26:54,228 --> 00:26:59,985
Speaker 1: this works, because these vision of

529
00:27:00,005 --> 00:27:02,639
Speaker 1: perfection that we experience becomes clear

530
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:03,743
Speaker 1: to us when we wake into enlightened

531
00:27:03,763 --> 00:27:04,044
Speaker 1: awareness.

532
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:09,999
Speaker 1: It's not just the experience of inherent

533
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:12,260
Speaker 1: perfection at the very core of reality, but

534
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:19,225
Speaker 1: it's also we see what's possible beyond the

535
00:27:19,285 --> 00:27:22,627
Speaker 1: mind, beyond fear, beyond doubt, beyond

536
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,830
Speaker 1: duality, beyond division, beyond ego

537
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,012
Speaker 1: individual ego, cultural ego, tribal ego,

538
00:27:31,854 --> 00:27:33,375
Speaker 1: male ego, female ego, beyond all

539
00:27:33,415 --> 00:27:40,857
Speaker 1: differences of self and other, world and

540
00:27:40,897 --> 00:27:42,582
Speaker 1: cosmos, beyond all differences, there's a

541
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,287
Speaker 1: vision of what's possible.

542
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:47,802
Speaker 1: When you experience these higher states of

543
00:27:47,822 --> 00:27:48,745
Speaker 1: consciousness, you see, this is the truth.

544
00:27:49,347 --> 00:27:51,535
Speaker 1: This is the truth, this is the truth.

545
00:27:52,535 --> 00:27:53,940
Speaker 1: And if you really have a very strong

546
00:27:53,981 --> 00:27:55,977
Speaker 1: experience, you want, you feel yourself

547
00:27:56,017 --> 00:27:59,045
Speaker 1: hopelessly compelled to try to mold the

548
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:00,938
Speaker 1: relative world, relative real, in that

549
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:01,239
Speaker 1: image.

550
00:28:02,142 --> 00:28:05,256
Speaker 1: Good luck, but that's how it works, that's

551
00:28:05,276 --> 00:28:06,140
Speaker 1: how it always works.

552
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:09,701
Speaker 1: So I want everybody to understand this

553
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:13,751
Speaker 1: utopian idealism as a product of the

554
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:14,734
Speaker 1: experience of higher states of

555
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:16,340
Speaker 1: consciousness, when they're very deep.

556
00:28:21,598 --> 00:28:23,262
Speaker 1: Because when you've seen this perfection

557
00:28:23,342 --> 00:28:27,356
Speaker 1: and this inconceivable goodness, when it's

558
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:31,662
Speaker 1: touched your heart so deeply, you want to

559
00:28:31,762 --> 00:28:34,741
Speaker 1: share it, it wants to be known and you feel

560
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:36,005
Speaker 1: that it wants to be known through you.

561
00:28:37,335 --> 00:28:42,090
Speaker 1: And so there comes upon you an

562
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:47,305
Speaker 1: indescribable compulsion to bear witness to

563
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,007
Speaker 1: the possible.

564
00:28:53,977 --> 00:28:55,182
Speaker 1: I've seen what's possible.

565
00:28:55,555 --> 00:28:56,641
Speaker 1: I've seen what's possible.

566
00:28:56,715 --> 00:28:58,080
Speaker 1: I've experienced what's possible.

567
00:28:58,802 --> 00:28:59,685
Speaker 1: I know what's possible.

568
00:29:00,275 --> 00:29:01,842
Speaker 1: Now I want to try and make it happen.

569
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,562
Speaker 1: Does anybody have anything better to do?

570
00:29:07,357 --> 00:29:08,602
Speaker 1: Self-compromise maybe.

571
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:11,875
Speaker 1: When you've seen what's possible and

572
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,482
Speaker 1: experienced what's possible in such a way

573
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:15,995
Speaker 1: that it's so utterly, utterly radical and

574
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:19,598
Speaker 1: utterly uncompromised, a truly inspired

575
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:21,036
Speaker 1: person feels there's nothing left for me to

576
00:29:21,076 --> 00:29:22,895
Speaker 1: do, but then to do whatever I can do to

577
00:29:23,016 --> 00:29:24,995
Speaker 1: actualize this extraordinary truth, this

578
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:26,862
Speaker 1: vision, in relative reality.

579
00:29:27,595 --> 00:29:30,463
Speaker 1: That's the transformation of the interior

580
00:29:30,483 --> 00:29:31,265
Speaker 1: of the cosmos.

581
00:29:36,695 --> 00:29:37,820
Speaker 1: I want to transform the interior of the

582
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,942
Speaker 1: cosmos from this bleak dimension of fear

583
00:29:41,543 --> 00:29:46,784
Speaker 1: and insecurity to one of love and joy and

584
00:29:46,824 --> 00:29:47,426
Speaker 1: celebration.

585
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,001
Speaker 1: This is what spiritually inspired people

586
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:58,968
Speaker 1: feel like, even if they're crazy, so so.

587
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,964
Speaker 1: So, in this vision of absolute reality, we

588
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:15,079
Speaker 1: glimpse perfection, and I want to make it

589
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:16,444
Speaker 1: very clear, as I often do on this point,

590
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:25,987
Speaker 1: that we can glimpse perfection in a higher

591
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:26,888
Speaker 1: state of consciousness.

592
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,420
Speaker 1: We can glimpse perfection, we can see it,

593
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,119
Speaker 1: we can feel it, we can know that which is

594
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,453
Speaker 1: perfect, absolutely perfect, indescribably

595
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:40,175
Speaker 1: perfect, unimaginably perfect.

596
00:30:47,102 --> 00:30:49,824
Speaker 1: But relative reality is part of a process,

597
00:30:50,164 --> 00:30:51,886
Speaker 1: part of an evolutionary and creative

598
00:30:51,926 --> 00:30:55,570
Speaker 1: process that's in a process of constant

599
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,232
Speaker 1: change and development.

600
00:31:00,636 --> 00:31:02,283
Speaker 1: Relative reality is not static.

601
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:11,280
Speaker 1: Relative reality is, as the Buddha himself

602
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,684
Speaker 1: stated, in a state of constant change,

603
00:31:16,286 --> 00:31:19,710
Speaker 1: development, rising and falling, moving and

604
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,351
Speaker 1: changing.

605
00:31:28,206 --> 00:31:32,505
Speaker 1: So we can never reach perfection in

606
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:33,387
Speaker 1: relative reality.

607
00:31:35,905 --> 00:31:38,073
Speaker 1: Perfection cannot be attained in relative

608
00:31:38,114 --> 00:31:38,475
Speaker 1: reality.

609
00:31:40,444 --> 00:31:43,318
Speaker 1: We can see perfection, experience

610
00:31:43,358 --> 00:31:45,910
Speaker 1: perfection and know perfection in a vision

611
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,895
Speaker 1: of absolute reality.

612
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:54,067
Speaker 1: We can know perfection, undoubtedly, in a

613
00:31:54,087 --> 00:31:55,378
Speaker 1: vision of absolute reality, in the

614
00:31:55,398 --> 00:31:57,159
Speaker 1: experience of absolute reality, in the

615
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,277
Speaker 1: awakening to absolute reality, but we can't

616
00:32:01,298 --> 00:32:03,754
Speaker 1: attain perfection in relative reality.

617
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:06,721
Speaker 1: It's unattainable because we're in a

618
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:08,699
Speaker 1: developmental process where the the

619
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,190
Speaker 1: unattainable because we're in a

620
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:19,650
Speaker 1: developmental process where the, where the

621
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,531
Speaker 1: we're always reaching for something that's

622
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,792
Speaker 1: possible but never ultimately reached or

623
00:32:23,812 --> 00:32:24,135
Speaker 1: attained.

624
00:32:31,845 --> 00:32:33,326
Speaker 1: So, in absolute reality, we can glimpse

625
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:33,867
Speaker 1: perfection.

626
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:36,350
Speaker 1: Relative reality, we can't attain

627
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:36,811
Speaker 1: perfection.

628
00:32:36,991 --> 00:32:38,558
Speaker 1: We can, but we can reach for it.

629
00:32:40,423 --> 00:32:41,245
Speaker 1: And this is the kicker.

630
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,395
Speaker 1: If you reach for perfection in relative

631
00:32:45,515 --> 00:32:48,341
Speaker 1: reality, whether you're a tennis player or

632
00:32:48,361 --> 00:32:50,947
Speaker 1: a photographer or a musician or a

633
00:32:50,987 --> 00:32:52,899
Speaker 1: philosopher, if you reach with all of your

634
00:32:52,939 --> 00:32:58,637
Speaker 1: heart and all of your might and all of your

635
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:01,156
Speaker 1: soul, if you reach for relative, if you

636
00:33:01,176 --> 00:33:05,897
Speaker 1: reach for perfection, you're gonna get a

637
00:33:05,937 --> 00:33:08,738
Speaker 1: lot closer to reaching it than if you don't

638
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:09,281
Speaker 1: even try.

639
00:33:17,676 --> 00:33:19,742
Speaker 1: So, once again, we can glimpse perfection

640
00:33:19,782 --> 00:33:23,399
Speaker 1: in absolute reality, but we can't attain

641
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:26,358
Speaker 1: perfection in relative reality, but don't

642
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:26,720
Speaker 1: give up.

643
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:30,722
Speaker 1: A lot of people realize this and then they

644
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,317
Speaker 1: say, well, there's no point in even trying

645
00:33:32,337 --> 00:33:33,681
Speaker 1: that I might as well just accept things as

646
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:37,138
Speaker 1: they are, which is a very popular spiritual

647
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:40,626
Speaker 1: technique Be with what is and accept things

648
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:41,127
Speaker 1: as they are.

649
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:45,136
Speaker 1: Why Things can be so much better than they

650
00:33:45,176 --> 00:33:46,618
Speaker 1: are, so much more extraordinary, profound,

651
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:47,839
Speaker 1: miraculous, amazing.

652
00:33:49,141 --> 00:33:49,822
Speaker 1: They really can.

653
00:33:50,963 --> 00:33:55,469
Speaker 1: But you've got to believe it and don't take

654
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:56,995
Speaker 1: my word for it, the only way you're going

655
00:33:57,015 --> 00:33:57,296
Speaker 1: to believe it.

656
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:58,961
Speaker 1: If you have these experiences that

657
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:00,746
Speaker 1: demonstrate it to you in your own soul,

658
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,677
Speaker 1: then you're going to know oh, things could

659
00:34:02,718 --> 00:34:03,499
Speaker 1: be so much better.

660
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:05,341
Speaker 1: I've experienced so much joy, peace and

661
00:34:05,381 --> 00:34:13,497
Speaker 1: happiness, exhilaration, love, ecstasy and

662
00:34:13,517 --> 00:34:14,522
Speaker 1: so much pure potential.

663
00:34:16,436 --> 00:34:18,683
Speaker 1: That kind of experience inspires us to want

664
00:34:18,703 --> 00:34:20,359
Speaker 1: to reach higher and to reach higher and to

665
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:20,902
Speaker 1: reach higher.

666
00:34:22,356 --> 00:34:28,026
Speaker 1: So, once again, how I see this making sense

667
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:32,003
Speaker 1: and it's working is that if we glimpse

668
00:34:32,043 --> 00:34:34,439
Speaker 1: these higher states which show us the

669
00:34:34,499 --> 00:34:38,079
Speaker 1: ultimate nature of reality as it is, those

670
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:40,731
Speaker 1: higher state experiences can inspire us to

671
00:34:40,771 --> 00:34:41,695
Speaker 1: reach higher and farther.

672
00:34:42,357 --> 00:34:45,358
Speaker 1: Within the context of relative reality, in

673
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:49,367
Speaker 1: the context of this human experience of

674
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:56,831
Speaker 1: being human, the higher we reach, the more

675
00:34:56,872 --> 00:35:00,103
Speaker 1: extraordinary the potentials are going to

676
00:35:00,123 --> 00:35:01,647
Speaker 1: be that emerge through us.

677
00:35:03,657 --> 00:35:05,123
Speaker 1: So, how high are we reaching?

678
00:35:06,941 --> 00:35:08,165
Speaker 1: How far are we actually trying to go?

679
00:35:09,697 --> 00:35:10,762
Speaker 1: Are we reaching for the stars?

680
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:14,842
Speaker 1: Because, for those people who reach for the

681
00:35:14,883 --> 00:35:17,935
Speaker 1: stars, see things, know things, understand

682
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,379
Speaker 1: things in a way that people who don't reach

683
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:20,683
Speaker 1: for the stars are never going to know.

684
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:26,541
Speaker 1: So the way I see it is that the experience

685
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:30,586
Speaker 1: of higher states of consciousness can be

686
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:33,070
Speaker 1: sources of non-relative or absolute

687
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:33,811
Speaker 1: inspiration.

688
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:40,065
Speaker 1: Inspiration to reach higher, to try harder,

689
00:35:41,195 --> 00:35:44,627
Speaker 1: to have even more faith, to have even more

690
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:46,776
Speaker 1: faith, to have even more faith oh, my

691
00:35:46,796 --> 00:35:48,918
Speaker 1: goodness, really, yes, to have even more

692
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:51,005
Speaker 1: faith and to be willing to make more effort

693
00:35:54,695 --> 00:35:57,204
Speaker 1: and not to settle for less than everything.

694
00:35:59,395 --> 00:36:00,680
Speaker 1: And if I'm not willing to settle for less

695
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,938
Speaker 1: than everything and you're not willing to

696
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:03,075
Speaker 1: settle for less than everything, then

697
00:36:03,095 --> 00:36:05,615
Speaker 1: together, as we engage with each other in

698
00:36:05,635 --> 00:36:12,886
Speaker 1: this human drama, our mutual yearning and

699
00:36:12,926 --> 00:36:19,035
Speaker 1: reaching will catalyze higher possibilities

700
00:36:19,115 --> 00:36:20,602
Speaker 1: and higher potentials to emerge between us.

701
00:36:24,655 --> 00:36:26,955
Speaker 1: So, but what's very important?

702
00:36:27,015 --> 00:36:31,841
Speaker 1: It's very important to know that that

703
00:36:31,861 --> 00:36:36,489
Speaker 1: perfection can be seen, but it can't be

704
00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:37,190
Speaker 1: actualized.

705
00:36:40,777 --> 00:36:42,663
Speaker 1: You can see that which is perfect and you

706
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:44,195
Speaker 1: can experience that which is perfect, but

707
00:36:44,215 --> 00:36:47,739
Speaker 1: you can never reach it, you can never

708
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,263
Speaker 1: actualize it, you can never manifest

709
00:36:49,283 --> 00:36:50,110
Speaker 1: perfection, you can never actualize it, you

710
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:50,715
Speaker 1: can never manifest perfection.

711
00:36:51,056 --> 00:36:52,683
Speaker 1: No human being can manifest perfection.

712
00:36:54,096 --> 00:36:56,965
Speaker 1: But we can all experience perfection.

713
00:36:58,536 --> 00:37:00,080
Speaker 1: And the more we experience perfection, the

714
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,162
Speaker 1: more we're going to want to try to

715
00:37:01,864 --> 00:37:03,315
Speaker 1: actualize it and manifest it, the more

716
00:37:03,336 --> 00:37:05,101
Speaker 1: we're going to be inspired to do everything

717
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:06,746
Speaker 1: we can to actualize it and manifest it.

718
00:37:08,756 --> 00:37:12,258
Speaker 1: And that gives rise to what I call creative

719
00:37:12,801 --> 00:37:13,684
Speaker 1: evolutionary tension.

720
00:37:17,697 --> 00:37:19,477
Speaker 1: And if we're spiritually inspired, we want

721
00:37:19,497 --> 00:37:21,182
Speaker 1: to kind of actualize this evolutionary

722
00:37:21,202 --> 00:37:21,543
Speaker 1: tension.

723
00:37:26,196 --> 00:37:27,662
Speaker 1: And what will inspire us to actualize that

724
00:37:27,702 --> 00:37:30,301
Speaker 1: evolutionary tension in the context of the

725
00:37:30,341 --> 00:37:34,979
Speaker 1: relative reality of our relative lives is

726
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:37,403
Speaker 1: the vision and direct gnosis and cognition

727
00:37:38,264 --> 00:37:44,478
Speaker 1: of absolute non-duality, directly

728
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:46,144
Speaker 1: experiencing the inherent perfection that

729
00:37:46,185 --> 00:37:48,755
Speaker 1: lies at the very center of everything.

730
00:37:48,855 --> 00:38:02,921
Speaker 1: That is so why do I chose the title

731
00:38:02,941 --> 00:38:05,910
Speaker 1: Rational Idealism?

732
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,615
Speaker 1: Rational Idealism is that we want to have

733
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:12,304
Speaker 1: the audacious courage to embrace utopian

734
00:38:12,344 --> 00:38:16,163
Speaker 1: idealism in all its promise, while having a

735
00:38:16,223 --> 00:38:19,077
Speaker 1: fiercely rational understanding of the way

736
00:38:19,117 --> 00:38:20,637
Speaker 1: reality actually works, knowing that we're

737
00:38:20,657 --> 00:38:21,660
Speaker 1: never going to actually be able to

738
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,142
Speaker 1: actualize it.

739
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:27,762
Speaker 1: We want to hold that paradox very much

740
00:38:27,963 --> 00:38:30,704
Speaker 1: alive in our hands and heart.

741
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:36,463
Speaker 1: I see utopia as an experience, as a higher

742
00:38:36,503 --> 00:38:40,021
Speaker 1: state of consciousness, and I want the

743
00:38:40,062 --> 00:38:41,129
Speaker 1: world that I'm living in and I'm

744
00:38:41,149 --> 00:38:42,597
Speaker 1: co-creating with everyone else to become an

745
00:38:42,637 --> 00:38:45,377
Speaker 1: expression of that utopian vision, while

746
00:38:45,397 --> 00:38:46,742
Speaker 1: fully knowing that we're never going to get

747
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:46,943
Speaker 1: there.

748
00:38:50,437 --> 00:38:51,645
Speaker 1: And even though I know we're never going to

749
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:52,591
Speaker 1: get there, and even though I know we're

750
00:38:52,612 --> 00:38:54,219
Speaker 1: never going to get there, we're going to

751
00:38:54,259 --> 00:38:54,541
Speaker 1: try.

752
00:38:56,756 --> 00:38:59,582
Speaker 1: We're being mediated and moderated by

753
00:38:59,683 --> 00:39:03,920
Speaker 1: rational discrimination, which should keep

754
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:12,148
Speaker 1: us sane, because if we're not careful, if

755
00:39:12,168 --> 00:39:14,979
Speaker 1: we try to actualize perfection in a context

756
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:17,399
Speaker 1: in which it can never be actualized, we're

757
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:18,182
Speaker 1: going to make a mess.

758
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:22,045
Speaker 1: This is why so many utopian experiments

759
00:39:22,065 --> 00:39:25,602
Speaker 1: have failed so miserably because this

760
00:39:25,642 --> 00:39:26,965
Speaker 1: distinction between absolute truth and

761
00:39:26,986 --> 00:39:29,014
Speaker 1: relative truth was not understood.

762
00:39:29,055 --> 00:39:32,227
Speaker 1: Relative reality is relative reality.

763
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:33,231
Speaker 1: Because this distinction between absolute

764
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:34,295
Speaker 1: truth and relative truth was not understood,

765
00:39:35,215 --> 00:39:38,860
Speaker 1: relative reality is relative reality and it

766
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,441
Speaker 1: can only always go so far.

767
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:43,026
Speaker 1: But if we are trying to revolutionize

768
00:39:43,066 --> 00:39:44,848
Speaker 1: relative reality inspired by a vision of

769
00:39:44,948 --> 00:39:53,937
Speaker 1: absolute reality, the world that we're

770
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:54,940
Speaker 1: living in, we're co-creating together, can

771
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,782
Speaker 1: become such an extraordinarily profoundly

772
00:39:55,802 --> 00:39:57,107
Speaker 1: positive, co-creative reflection of the

773
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:57,588
Speaker 1: possible.

774
00:39:59,755 --> 00:40:01,061
Speaker 1: But what a delicate paradox.

775
00:40:01,195 --> 00:40:02,179
Speaker 1: We all have to learn how to hold.

776
00:40:13,315 --> 00:40:14,117
Speaker 1: To repeat we can all know that which is

777
00:40:14,137 --> 00:40:14,940
Speaker 1: perfect, but we can never know that which

778
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,783
Speaker 1: is perfect, but we can never be that which

779
00:40:15,803 --> 00:40:16,003
Speaker 1: is perfect.

780
00:40:16,023 --> 00:40:17,548
Speaker 1: We can know that which is perfect, but we

781
00:40:17,568 --> 00:40:18,812
Speaker 1: can never be that which is perfect.

782
00:40:22,424 --> 00:40:27,739
Speaker 1: It doesn't intimidate me if we have fragile,

783
00:40:28,201 --> 00:40:30,045
Speaker 1: if we have fragile egos, oh, I can't be

784
00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:30,366
Speaker 1: perfect.

785
00:40:30,406 --> 00:40:31,128
Speaker 1: Will I give up?

786
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,305
Speaker 1: No, we got to grow up and be stronger than

787
00:40:34,345 --> 00:40:34,505
Speaker 1: that.

788
00:40:36,905 --> 00:40:38,332
Speaker 1: No, we can't be perfect, we're never going

789
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,055
Speaker 1: to reach perfection.

790
00:40:42,944 --> 00:40:45,670
Speaker 1: But but we want to try and reach it.

791
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,214
Speaker 1: We want to try and reach the perfection

792
00:40:47,274 --> 00:40:48,818
Speaker 1: anyway, fully knowing beforehand that we're

793
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:49,580
Speaker 1: never going to get there.

794
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:51,005
Speaker 1: And that's where the action is, that's

795
00:40:51,045 --> 00:40:54,221
Speaker 1: where the that's where evolutionary

796
00:40:54,261 --> 00:40:55,343
Speaker 1: emergence comes from.

797
00:40:55,844 --> 00:40:58,469
Speaker 1: Holding that tension, tension, that paradox,

798
00:41:00,921 --> 00:41:06,180
Speaker 1: it requires a bit of spiritual heroism and

799
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:16,216
Speaker 1: metaphysical exuberance and audacity, and

800
00:41:16,236 --> 00:41:17,199
Speaker 1: learning how to hold these two truths is a

801
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:18,984
Speaker 1: big part of what it means to be a mature

802
00:41:19,065 --> 00:41:27,877
Speaker 1: realizer Holding the paradox, embracing the

803
00:41:27,897 --> 00:41:29,704
Speaker 1: paradox and living the paradox earnestly.

804
00:41:33,495 --> 00:41:36,024
Speaker 1: So, for example, if we're truly audacious,

805
00:41:36,075 --> 00:41:39,091
Speaker 1: we want to have the courage to bear witness

806
00:41:39,131 --> 00:41:42,020
Speaker 1: to that perfection in a cynical world

807
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,407
Speaker 1: that's so full of doubt and arrogance and

808
00:41:45,507 --> 00:41:46,008
Speaker 1: nihilism.

809
00:41:47,577 --> 00:41:49,840
Speaker 1: That takes courage To bear witness, to

810
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,611
Speaker 1: choose to bear witness, as yourself, to

811
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:55,201
Speaker 1: that perfection in such a cynical,

812
00:41:56,664 --> 00:41:58,828
Speaker 1: nihilistic, doubtful, fearful, angry world

813
00:41:58,848 --> 00:41:59,149
Speaker 1: space.

814
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:01,300
Speaker 1: That takes courage.

815
00:42:13,435 --> 00:42:14,497
Speaker 1: As I always like to say, consciousness

816
00:42:14,517 --> 00:42:20,988
Speaker 1: delights in its own self-recognition.

817
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:22,751
Speaker 1: So, if I can share my awakened inspiration

818
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:25,820
Speaker 1: with you, it can awaken that same

819
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,286
Speaker 1: inspiration in you.

820
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:30,678
Speaker 1: And if you catch fire, you can awaken that

821
00:42:30,698 --> 00:42:31,240
Speaker 1: same inspiration in you.

822
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,383
Speaker 1: And if you catch fire, you can awaken that

823
00:42:32,423 --> 00:42:33,486
Speaker 1: same inspiration in others.

824
00:42:37,296 --> 00:42:39,962
Speaker 1: So, while I feel that our metaphysical

825
00:42:40,022 --> 00:42:42,988
Speaker 1: aspirations need to be mediated and

826
00:42:43,035 --> 00:42:46,281
Speaker 1: moderated by a ferocious, rational,

827
00:42:49,788 --> 00:42:57,334
Speaker 1: contemplative, observing vision, we don't

828
00:42:57,374 --> 00:43:00,135
Speaker 1: want, we don't want the the unbelievable

829
00:43:01,386 --> 00:43:04,001
Speaker 1: potential that exists to be suffocated by

830
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:06,242
Speaker 1: being too rational about all this.

831
00:43:06,716 --> 00:43:12,573
Speaker 1: We want to use our rational faculties too

832
00:43:12,613 --> 00:43:13,175
Speaker 1: rational about all this.

833
00:43:13,615 --> 00:43:14,586
Speaker 1: We wanna use our rational faculties to help

834
00:43:14,627 --> 00:43:15,677
Speaker 1: us stay on the right track, but we don't

835
00:43:15,697 --> 00:43:17,197
Speaker 1: want them to suffocate and snuff out the

836
00:43:17,237 --> 00:43:22,777
Speaker 1: fire of unconditional liberation, as it can

837
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:23,982
Speaker 1: and as it does and as it will.

838
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,602
Speaker 1: If we're not careful, if we get too smart

839
00:43:26,622 --> 00:43:30,059
Speaker 1: about all this, we can kill God without

840
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:31,718
Speaker 1: even knowing we're doing it because we're

841
00:43:31,738 --> 00:43:32,843
Speaker 1: just too smart for our own good.

842
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,783
Speaker 1: As long as we privilege the mind, in the

843
00:43:42,943 --> 00:43:46,697
Speaker 1: end God's going to disappear.

844
00:43:58,663 --> 00:44:00,107
Speaker 1: So we want to learn how to be very

845
00:44:03,304 --> 00:44:05,232
Speaker 1: sophisticated thinkers while simultaneously

846
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:08,295
Speaker 1: being experts and transcending the mind and

847
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:10,623
Speaker 1: throwing it into the garbage can when

848
00:44:10,663 --> 00:44:13,222
Speaker 1: necessary, which is probably every day a

849
00:44:13,242 --> 00:44:13,704
Speaker 1: few times.

850
00:44:18,836 --> 00:44:20,963
Speaker 1: So this is why I use the title rational

851
00:44:21,364 --> 00:44:21,865
Speaker 1: idealism.

852
00:44:22,095 --> 00:44:28,138
Speaker 1: Now you can understand why I think we need

853
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:29,544
Speaker 1: to have the courage to be idealistic.

854
00:44:29,997 --> 00:44:30,700
Speaker 1: It takes guts.

855
00:44:32,801 --> 00:44:35,078
Speaker 1: It's not cool to be too idealistic, people

856
00:44:35,098 --> 00:44:35,238
Speaker 1: think.

857
00:44:35,399 --> 00:44:38,047
Speaker 1: If you get too idealistic, too inspired by

858
00:44:38,088 --> 00:44:41,323
Speaker 1: this pure positivity, people think you're

859
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:45,555
Speaker 1: naive, foolish, dangerous and so probably.

860
00:44:48,742 --> 00:44:51,087
Speaker 1: But deep and profound realizers are wild

861
00:44:51,227 --> 00:44:55,486
Speaker 1: characters who've shunned convention.

862
00:44:55,915 --> 00:44:58,343
Speaker 1: They're not afraid of the audacious nature

863
00:44:58,363 --> 00:44:59,246
Speaker 1: of this pure positivity.

864
00:44:59,335 --> 00:45:02,243
Speaker 1: They're not afraid to be exemplars of it in

865
00:45:02,263 --> 00:45:03,607
Speaker 1: the face of this believing world.

866
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:07,256
Speaker 1: And that's a challenge for all of us.

867
00:45:07,336 --> 00:45:31,694
Speaker 1: If we're sincere, I believe Just to repeat,

868
00:45:31,755 --> 00:45:37,133
Speaker 1: we can experience perfection, but we can't

869
00:45:37,153 --> 00:45:37,474
Speaker 1: be perfection.

870
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:41,126
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean we shouldn't always try to

871
00:45:41,146 --> 00:45:49,149
Speaker 1: be better, try to be more perfect, and we

872
00:45:49,189 --> 00:45:53,966
Speaker 1: want to try and embrace the tension between,

873
00:45:56,466 --> 00:45:57,933
Speaker 1: the tension inherent in reaching for

874
00:45:57,993 --> 00:45:59,396
Speaker 1: perfection that can't be reached.

875
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,112
Speaker 1: We want to try to give this higher

876
00:46:19,132 --> 00:46:22,743
Speaker 1: consciousness no excuse not to work through

877
00:46:22,824 --> 00:46:22,904
Speaker 1: us.

878
00:46:26,056 --> 00:46:27,721
Speaker 1: If we leave too much room for self-doubt

879
00:46:27,781 --> 00:46:30,196
Speaker 1: and self-hatred and self-loathing, fear,

880
00:46:31,238 --> 00:46:40,296
Speaker 1: depression, nihilism and arrogance, the

881
00:46:40,336 --> 00:46:41,983
Speaker 1: consciousness won't show its face.

882
00:46:45,096 --> 00:46:46,881
Speaker 1: We need to be worthy vehicles of this

883
00:46:48,084 --> 00:46:51,161
Speaker 1: vision of perfection, which means you've

884
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:54,199
Speaker 1: got to believe in it, you've got to trust

885
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:57,897
Speaker 1: in it and have great, so much faith, and

886
00:46:57,917 --> 00:47:00,645
Speaker 1: this consciousness will know if that's your

887
00:47:00,685 --> 00:47:01,026
Speaker 1: position.

888
00:47:01,416 --> 00:47:02,800
Speaker 1: If you have that much faith and have that

889
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:07,218
Speaker 1: much conviction, that consciousness will

890
00:47:07,258 --> 00:47:11,817
Speaker 1: reveal itself to you, within you most part,

891
00:47:11,837 --> 00:47:12,540
Speaker 1: to speak through you.

892
00:47:15,837 --> 00:47:17,476
Speaker 1: So while we need the mind, we need to be

893
00:47:17,517 --> 00:47:20,918
Speaker 1: good thinkers, to be smart people, to help

894
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:22,062
Speaker 1: us make the right choices.

895
00:47:22,616 --> 00:47:25,502
Speaker 1: We don't want to be a slave to rational

896
00:47:25,522 --> 00:47:25,863
Speaker 1: thinking.

897
00:47:28,737 --> 00:47:30,262
Speaker 1: We don't want the rational mind to be our

898
00:47:30,323 --> 00:47:32,315
Speaker 1: God, our servant.

899
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,134
Speaker 1: Enlightened awareness is not reasonable,

900
00:48:12,335 --> 00:48:16,172
Speaker 1: it's not rational, it's unreasonable and

901
00:48:16,212 --> 00:48:16,895
Speaker 1: transrational.

902
00:48:22,026 --> 00:48:23,569
Speaker 1: It doesn't fit in to anything.

903
00:48:24,997 --> 00:48:26,319
Speaker 1: It uploads everything out of the water.

904
00:48:38,995 --> 00:48:41,305
Speaker 1: So we want to try and have liberated and

905
00:48:41,325 --> 00:48:42,169
Speaker 1: unconditioned awareness.

906
00:48:46,697 --> 00:48:48,565
Speaker 1: Liberated, unconditioned, enlightened

907
00:48:48,585 --> 00:48:50,483
Speaker 1: awareness and rational thinking, but not

908
00:48:50,503 --> 00:48:53,322
Speaker 1: rational thinking, and then a little bit of

909
00:48:53,362 --> 00:48:54,125
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness.

910
00:49:00,996 --> 00:49:01,759
Speaker 1: You let go of the mind.

911
00:49:01,779 --> 00:49:03,636
Speaker 1: You have to let go of your ego too, because

912
00:49:03,656 --> 00:49:04,517
Speaker 1: the two work together.

913
00:49:09,603 --> 00:49:10,884
Speaker 1: A lot of people want to let go of their

914
00:49:10,904 --> 00:49:12,046
Speaker 1: mind, but their mind doesn't seem to want

915
00:49:12,066 --> 00:49:12,326
Speaker 1: to go.

916
00:49:13,307 --> 00:49:14,689
Speaker 1: They don't realize that it's because their

917
00:49:14,729 --> 00:49:16,251
Speaker 1: ego is trying to let go, trying to do the

918
00:49:16,291 --> 00:49:16,611
Speaker 1: letting go.

919
00:49:26,235 --> 00:49:27,078
Speaker 1: It doesn't work that way.

920
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:28,122
Speaker 1: Your ego will never let go of your mind.

921
00:49:28,162 --> 00:49:28,885
Speaker 1: It'll never let go of the mind.

922
00:49:28,905 --> 00:49:30,009
Speaker 1: So if your ego, as you, usurped your

923
00:49:30,049 --> 00:49:33,444
Speaker 1: spiritual impulse, if your ego is trying to

924
00:49:33,465 --> 00:49:35,851
Speaker 1: get enlightened, it ain't never going to

925
00:49:35,871 --> 00:49:41,844
Speaker 1: work, of course.

926
00:49:41,924 --> 00:49:43,928
Speaker 1: So the difficult part in all this and it

927
00:49:43,988 --> 00:49:49,869
Speaker 1: sounds very mundane or trite even, but it's

928
00:49:49,889 --> 00:49:51,357
Speaker 1: true, and if you want to awaken to

929
00:49:51,377 --> 00:49:53,343
Speaker 1: enlightened awareness, to transrational

930
00:49:53,363 --> 00:49:54,596
Speaker 1: gnosis, consciousness and cognition, the

931
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:57,458
Speaker 1: ego's got to take a hike, it has to go away,

932
00:49:58,415 --> 00:49:59,861
Speaker 1: it has to be transcended, fiercely,

933
00:49:59,921 --> 00:50:02,721
Speaker 1: ferociously, absolutely and completely.

934
00:50:02,841 --> 00:50:08,696
Speaker 1: At least for a few moments, you have to be

935
00:50:08,737 --> 00:50:10,584
Speaker 1: able to stand free from your ego.

936
00:50:12,188 --> 00:50:13,778
Speaker 1: Stand free from your ego, your mind will

937
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:19,009
Speaker 1: also be transcended, and then you get a

938
00:50:19,029 --> 00:50:21,345
Speaker 1: glimpse of higher consciousness, will make

939
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:22,615
Speaker 1: that leap from relative to absolute

940
00:50:23,748 --> 00:50:24,275
Speaker 1: perspectives.

941
00:50:25,425 --> 00:50:26,575
Speaker 1: You start to see things differently.

942
00:50:26,777 --> 00:50:28,715
Speaker 1: Reality will appear so differently.

943
00:50:30,921 --> 00:50:32,385
Speaker 1: You get a glimpse of who you really are and

944
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:32,986
Speaker 1: who you can be.

945
00:50:37,064 --> 00:50:38,748
Speaker 1: We all can be so much more than we think

946
00:50:38,896 --> 00:50:40,271
Speaker 1: it's possible because we're always just

947
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:42,001
Speaker 1: thinking about this very rationally.

948
00:50:47,323 --> 00:50:48,906
Speaker 1: We have to be unreasonable at a certain

949
00:50:48,926 --> 00:50:49,206
Speaker 1: point.

950
00:50:54,495 --> 00:50:56,059
Speaker 1: Life itself isn't very reasonable, is it so

951
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:58,444
Speaker 1: if we want to awaken in a way that's

952
00:50:58,465 --> 00:51:03,086
Speaker 1: profound and outrageous, we have to also be

953
00:51:03,106 --> 00:51:05,837
Speaker 1: unreasonable, take enormous risks and have

954
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:07,319
Speaker 1: unimaginable faith.
