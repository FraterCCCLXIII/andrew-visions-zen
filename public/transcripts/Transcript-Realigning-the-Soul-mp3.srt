1
00:00:01,063 --> 00:00:02,647
Speaker 1: So I want to speak a little bit about my

2
00:00:02,708 --> 00:00:05,342
Speaker 1: understanding of the nature of the soul as

3
00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:06,966
Speaker 1: it relates to the awakened, to enlightened

4
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:15,430
Speaker 1: awareness, and keep in mind that when we

5
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:19,062
Speaker 1: are speaking about such deep matters and

6
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:22,443
Speaker 1: the soul is a very deep matter we're

7
00:00:22,483 --> 00:00:25,952
Speaker 1: entering into speculative inquiry.

8
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:29,361
Speaker 1: So I'm going to share with you what I my my

9
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:31,025
Speaker 1: personal understanding, what I've come to,

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,411
Speaker 1: but it's all.

11
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:33,672
Speaker 1: It's all.

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,426
Speaker 1: It's all a work in progress, remains a work

13
00:00:35,466 --> 00:00:35,968
Speaker 1: in progress.

14
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:39,226
Speaker 1: I'm a work in progress, my ideas are a work

15
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:42,364
Speaker 1: in progress, but I think, I think some of

16
00:00:42,404 --> 00:00:43,869
Speaker 1: the distinctions I'm going to try and make,

17
00:00:45,742 --> 00:00:46,867
Speaker 1: some of you might find helpful.

18
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:57,184
Speaker 1: So, just to be clear that, because I'm a

19
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,541
Speaker 1: teacher of enlightenment, everything that I

20
00:00:58,581 --> 00:01:01,950
Speaker 1: speak about relates to the metaphysical

21
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:07,852
Speaker 1: context of the highest spiritual

22
00:01:07,872 --> 00:01:13,848
Speaker 1: transformation, the most profound shift in

23
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:16,580
Speaker 1: consciousness that we know about, when it

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,170
Speaker 1: leads to unimaginable liberation and inner

25
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,172
Speaker 1: freedom and joy and happiness, contentment.

26
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:33,250
Speaker 1: So I'll speak.

27
00:01:36,082 --> 00:01:41,010
Speaker 1: I want to describe a simple map, a way to

28
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,765
Speaker 1: help you understand these distinctions in

29
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:47,230
Speaker 1: the context in which I'm speaking about it.

30
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:56,867
Speaker 1: So the soul, in the way we use the word,

31
00:01:56,988 --> 00:02:01,316
Speaker 1: usually refers to one of the deepest parts

32
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:03,240
Speaker 1: of our humanity.

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,086
Speaker 1: One of the deepest parts of our humanity

34
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:08,031
Speaker 1: when we usually refer to our soul or the

35
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:17,323
Speaker 1: soul, we're referring to a level of

36
00:02:17,343 --> 00:02:18,366
Speaker 1: emotional and spiritual depth that is

37
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:19,049
Speaker 1: inherently meaningful.

38
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:22,988
Speaker 1: When people start speaking about the soul,

39
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,265
Speaker 1: we know that they're not speaking about

40
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:25,048
Speaker 1: superficial matters.

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,103
Speaker 1: They're speaking about matters that are

42
00:02:26,123 --> 00:02:28,611
Speaker 1: deep and sincere and serious.

43
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,351
Speaker 1: So I want to talk about the nature of the

44
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:39,131
Speaker 1: soul in relationship to enlightenment.

45
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,865
Speaker 1: So so at the.

46
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:56,277
Speaker 1: So we want to start with looking at the

47
00:02:56,297 --> 00:02:56,660
Speaker 1: nature of the ego.

48
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:00,173
Speaker 1: The ego is the frontal cell.

49
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:05,723
Speaker 1: The ego is the.

50
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:06,574
Speaker 1: It plays a dominant role in the formation

51
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:07,040
Speaker 1: of the self-structure.

52
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:15,690
Speaker 1: It, the ego, is the organizing principle in

53
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:16,098
Speaker 1: the psyche.

54
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:18,408
Speaker 1: It creates coherence.

55
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:24,382
Speaker 1: So it's just to speak in very broad,

56
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:25,243
Speaker 1: general terms.

57
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:31,467
Speaker 1: If the ego is that structure in the psyche

58
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:34,469
Speaker 1: that creates coherence or a sense of

59
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,831
Speaker 1: wholeness, then we want that.

60
00:03:36,931 --> 00:03:38,332
Speaker 1: That when the ego structure is not coherent

61
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:50,747
Speaker 1: or is incoherent, then usually the person

62
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:52,933
Speaker 1: is in trouble of some kind.

63
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,629
Speaker 1: So the ego is the ego very much relates to

64
00:03:57,669 --> 00:03:57,769
Speaker 1: the.

65
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,726
Speaker 1: In the way that I'm speaking about it now

66
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,085
Speaker 1: very much relates to the structure of the

67
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:04,245
Speaker 1: personality, and in the way I'm speaking

68
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:06,303
Speaker 1: about it now, we can interchangeably use

69
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:13,402
Speaker 1: the word ego to mean, in this context, the

70
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:15,146
Speaker 1: nature of Andrew's personality, the nature

71
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:18,112
Speaker 1: of Andrew's ego, for example, in the way

72
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:18,794
Speaker 1: I'm speaking about it now.

73
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,351
Speaker 1: I'm not speaking about the ego as a demon,

74
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,465
Speaker 1: because often in enlightenment contexts,

75
00:04:25,622 --> 00:04:27,045
Speaker 1: the ego as a demon, because often in

76
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:28,007
Speaker 1: enlightenment contexts, the ego is the

77
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:29,751
Speaker 1: demon that we need to transcend in order to

78
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:39,071
Speaker 1: be spiritually liberated, which is also

79
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:39,232
Speaker 1: true.

80
00:04:39,252 --> 00:04:40,216
Speaker 1: But that's not the context in which I'm

81
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:41,179
Speaker 1: speaking about it for this talk.

82
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,704
Speaker 1: So for this talk, we want to understand the

83
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:42,985
Speaker 1: ego structure.

84
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:44,509
Speaker 1: Is the, is that structure that coheres the

85
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,252
Speaker 1: personality?

86
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,712
Speaker 1: It creates a healthy, integrated frontal

87
00:04:50,752 --> 00:04:52,064
Speaker 1: self, what Ken Wilber would call the

88
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:52,627
Speaker 1: frontal self.

89
00:04:58,542 --> 00:04:59,841
Speaker 1: And just to add to that, of course, the ego

90
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:03,210
Speaker 1: can have positive expressions and negative

91
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:03,792
Speaker 1: expressions.

92
00:05:05,702 --> 00:05:07,469
Speaker 1: It can be a positive ego and a negative ego,

93
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,404
Speaker 1: a happy ego and a sad ego, a joyous ego and

94
00:05:12,504 --> 00:05:17,026
Speaker 1: an angry ego, a liberated ego and a

95
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:18,450
Speaker 1: victimized ego.

96
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,884
Speaker 1: I'm sure you all know what I'm talking

97
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,389
Speaker 1: about from your own experience.

98
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:30,470
Speaker 1: But the ego, the ego is not the deepest

99
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,783
Speaker 1: part of the self, and so whenever we hear

100
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:41,645
Speaker 1: people refer to the soul, refer to my, I

101
00:05:41,745 --> 00:05:43,030
Speaker 1: feel it in my soul.

102
00:05:45,143 --> 00:05:47,318
Speaker 1: I could feel it in my soul, I could feel it

103
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:50,247
Speaker 1: in her soul we were always pointing.

104
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:51,902
Speaker 1: When we speak that way, we were generally

105
00:05:51,922 --> 00:05:55,231
Speaker 1: pointing to a deeper structure in the self,

106
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:58,901
Speaker 1: a deeper structure than the frontal self, a

107
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:00,446
Speaker 1: deeper structure than the personality, than

108
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:05,148
Speaker 1: the ego personality, referring to a deeper

109
00:06:05,188 --> 00:06:09,314
Speaker 1: dimension of the self that generally is

110
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:11,863
Speaker 1: considered to be more authentic and carry

111
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:15,332
Speaker 1: more truth, whatever that means.

112
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,407
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that usually, when we

113
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:22,483
Speaker 1: ourselves refer to our own souls or the

114
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:25,244
Speaker 1: soul of another, we're referring to deeper

115
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:30,491
Speaker 1: dimensions of the self than is the, than

116
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:32,365
Speaker 1: that of the ego or the frontal personality.

117
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,145
Speaker 1: He has a very deep soul, she is a deep soul,

118
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,568
Speaker 1: she's an old soul, for example.

119
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,351
Speaker 1: So I was talking about the nature of the

120
00:06:50,372 --> 00:06:54,269
Speaker 1: ego, the soul and the true self and the

121
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:58,310
Speaker 1: true self is the deepest is, from a

122
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:00,133
Speaker 1: spiritual perspective, from a metaphysical

123
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:03,088
Speaker 1: perspective, from the perspective of the

124
00:07:03,128 --> 00:07:09,137
Speaker 1: perennial philosophy, the true self is the

125
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,781
Speaker 1: deepest dimension of the self and the

126
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:12,323
Speaker 1: deepest dimension of reality itself.

127
00:07:15,346 --> 00:07:22,994
Speaker 1: So the ego is relates to our personal

128
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:30,285
Speaker 1: history, the soul relates to, I believe,

129
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,349
Speaker 1: all the experience we've ever had as an

130
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,295
Speaker 1: evolving soul or, if one would believe it

131
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:42,655
Speaker 1: or think that way, over many lifetimes.

132
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:46,394
Speaker 1: And the self, the true self, exists in a

133
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:47,801
Speaker 1: realm of dimension and reality that is

134
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:49,626
Speaker 1: timeless and formless and beginning and

135
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,491
Speaker 1: endless and ultimately eternal.

136
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:57,090
Speaker 1: And remember, when I'm speaking about the

137
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:58,900
Speaker 1: ego and the soul and the true self, I'm

138
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:01,850
Speaker 1: speaking about myself, I'm speaking about

139
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,291
Speaker 1: yourself.

140
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:07,500
Speaker 1: So when we make these kinds of distinctions,

141
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:09,348
Speaker 1: we don't want to get too abstract about it,

142
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,247
Speaker 1: but we want to relate to, we want to try

143
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:18,177
Speaker 1: and locate the sense of being an ego or a

144
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:23,209
Speaker 1: unique personality within ourself.

145
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:25,181
Speaker 1: As we're on an inquiry like this, we want

146
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:33,347
Speaker 1: to find our own ego and we want to find our

147
00:08:33,427 --> 00:08:37,048
Speaker 1: own soul, which is a good thing to find.

148
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,520
Speaker 1: People that haven't found their own souls

149
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:46,546
Speaker 1: are generally not in great shape and, for

150
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:48,161
Speaker 1: the seekers after enlightenment, we want to

151
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:49,286
Speaker 1: find our true self.

152
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,686
Speaker 1: Our true self is the part of ourself

153
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:54,970
Speaker 1: because it is one with eternity.

154
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:59,774
Speaker 1: It's a place where we find unconditional

155
00:09:00,558 --> 00:09:03,288
Speaker 1: freedom, because it's a place where time

156
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:04,010
Speaker 1: does not exist.

157
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:09,225
Speaker 1: The true self is a source of spiritual

158
00:09:09,265 --> 00:09:11,431
Speaker 1: freedom yeah, inner freedom, spiritual

159
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:11,932
Speaker 1: liberation.

160
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:23,693
Speaker 1: So the ego is the source of the feelings of

161
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:27,619
Speaker 1: being a unique personal entity.

162
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:35,221
Speaker 1: It's a place where we experience pride, the

163
00:09:35,261 --> 00:09:41,637
Speaker 1: experience of the process that most of us

164
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,126
Speaker 1: find ourselves in the midst of, of having a

165
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:45,390
Speaker 1: personal experience.

166
00:09:47,502 --> 00:09:50,687
Speaker 1: It's when experience, it happens in time,

167
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,386
Speaker 1: it's when experience feels very personal

168
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:52,868
Speaker 1: and unique.

169
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:56,664
Speaker 1: To me, the ego is the source of this

170
00:09:56,785 --> 00:09:58,880
Speaker 1: feeling of a personal process, of a

171
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:00,006
Speaker 1: personal event happening.

172
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,689
Speaker 1: That's the self-structure in which feels,

173
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:07,046
Speaker 1: in which the experience of embodied

174
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,842
Speaker 1: consciousness is experienced as being a

175
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:11,225
Speaker 1: personal event, something that's happening

176
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:12,610
Speaker 1: to a unique self of me.

177
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:18,983
Speaker 1: So I always like to say that the soul, what

178
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:22,308
Speaker 1: I'm calling the soul, is the deepest part

179
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:24,720
Speaker 1: of the self that's still personal.

180
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,477
Speaker 1: So the soul is the deepest part of the self

181
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:27,940
Speaker 1: that's still personal.

182
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,129
Speaker 1: So the soul comes from a much deeper source

183
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,361
Speaker 1: and I like to refer to the soul as the

184
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:36,249
Speaker 1: metaphysical organ.

185
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,203
Speaker 1: We could call it that, for lack of a better

186
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:38,806
Speaker 1: way of putting it.

187
00:10:40,046 --> 00:10:46,211
Speaker 1: The soul is a metaphysical organ that

188
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:46,913
Speaker 1: carries with it.

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,546
Speaker 1: If you believe in the continuity of

190
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,948
Speaker 1: consciousness and I very much believe I

191
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:53,004
Speaker 1: can't prove it to you, but I very much

192
00:10:53,024 --> 00:10:54,620
Speaker 1: believe in the continuity of consciousness

193
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,612
Speaker 1: I believe that the self, or that our soul,

194
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:05,098
Speaker 1: is on a journey of becoming, in a context

195
00:11:05,138 --> 00:11:08,417
Speaker 1: of evolution, just like just with the rest

196
00:11:08,457 --> 00:11:08,879
Speaker 1: of the cosmos.

197
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:14,651
Speaker 1: So the soul would be the receptacle which

198
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:16,502
Speaker 1: would contain all the memories of all the

199
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:19,346
Speaker 1: experiences you've ever had, going back to

200
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:20,742
Speaker 1: the very beginning of time and even the

201
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:21,585
Speaker 1: beginning of the universe.

202
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:25,169
Speaker 1: I believe that when I say it's something I

203
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:25,430
Speaker 1: believe.

204
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,063
Speaker 1: It's something that I'm.

205
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,467
Speaker 1: It's really a belief, I can't prove to you,

206
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,729
Speaker 1: but the soul is the metaphysical vessel

207
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:37,000
Speaker 1: that remains a constant and that is, I

208
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:39,688
Speaker 1: believe that, a process of growth and

209
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:42,847
Speaker 1: development through different incarnations

210
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:46,043
Speaker 1: and different processes of embodied

211
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:47,789
Speaker 1: consciousness over time.

212
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,489
Speaker 1: But the soul is a place where we experience

213
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:06,275
Speaker 1: our deepest emotions, our deepest feelings

214
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,365
Speaker 1: that still have a connection to our

215
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:13,285
Speaker 1: personal sense of self identity.

216
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,647
Speaker 1: But these are deeper kinds of feelings.

217
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,726
Speaker 1: We could say in this context that the ego

218
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:25,303
Speaker 1: experiences all kinds of emotions and

219
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:28,251
Speaker 1: feelings, likes and dislikes.

220
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:33,028
Speaker 1: But the preferences and likes and dislikes

221
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:36,745
Speaker 1: of the ego in this context would be

222
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:39,371
Speaker 1: considered to be much more superficial in

223
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:41,986
Speaker 1: general than the feelings that we

224
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:43,671
Speaker 1: experience at the level of our souls.

225
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,311
Speaker 1: So, for example, maybe we meet, as some

226
00:12:48,331 --> 00:12:50,283
Speaker 1: people like to talk about, maybe we meet

227
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:51,187
Speaker 1: our soulmate.

228
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:59,198
Speaker 1: When I met her I recognized instantaneously

229
00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:03,788
Speaker 1: and miraculously that she was my soulmate

230
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:05,311
Speaker 1: and that we'd been waiting for each other

231
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:05,752
Speaker 1: for years.

232
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:06,333
Speaker 1: That kind of thing.

233
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,247
Speaker 1: It's when we experience deeper kinds of

234
00:13:10,508 --> 00:13:13,198
Speaker 1: non-superficial, deeper kinds of feelings

235
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:16,780
Speaker 1: that relate to our experience of life, but

236
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,567
Speaker 1: these feelings are occurring in a much

237
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:21,546
Speaker 1: deeper strata, a dimension of experience.

238
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:27,386
Speaker 1: We feel deeper connections and deeper

239
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:33,029
Speaker 1: contexts, maybe a deeper sense of meaning

240
00:13:34,884 --> 00:13:36,509
Speaker 1: and also maybe a deeper sense of loss and

241
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,706
Speaker 1: grief, relationships and loss and grief.

242
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:43,049
Speaker 1: But the soul is the dimension of ourself

243
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,747
Speaker 1: where we experience our deepest feelings

244
00:13:46,946 --> 00:13:49,211
Speaker 1: that are still related to ourselves

245
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,966
Speaker 1: personally but are much deeper than the

246
00:13:51,027 --> 00:13:53,118
Speaker 1: realm of the kinds of emotions we

247
00:13:53,158 --> 00:13:54,625
Speaker 1: experience at the level of the ego, which

248
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:55,548
Speaker 1: is much more superficial.

249
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,444
Speaker 1: And of course, the idea in terms of

250
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:07,211
Speaker 1: spiritual evolution is to train ourselves

251
00:14:09,837 --> 00:14:12,464
Speaker 1: to cease to experience life from the

252
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:14,875
Speaker 1: vantage point that is so superficial to a

253
00:14:14,915 --> 00:14:16,361
Speaker 1: vantage point perspective that's much

254
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:21,848
Speaker 1: deeper, much more authentic, much more

255
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:27,135
Speaker 1: meaningful and therefore has inherently

256
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:27,756
Speaker 1: greater value.

257
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:32,196
Speaker 1: One feels with people that are very

258
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:33,684
Speaker 1: superficial that they're just skirting

259
00:14:33,704 --> 00:14:36,208
Speaker 1: along on the surface of life because

260
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:37,597
Speaker 1: they're not connected to any deeper parts

261
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:39,306
Speaker 1: of themselves or deeper parts of reality,

262
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:46,470
Speaker 1: and that can be tedious and unsatisfying

263
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,693
Speaker 1: for people with greater depth.

264
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:51,827
Speaker 1: But when you meet people who have greater

265
00:14:51,888 --> 00:14:54,026
Speaker 1: depth, you feel that you're meeting them at

266
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:58,707
Speaker 1: the level of the soul and then there seems

267
00:14:58,727 --> 00:15:02,241
Speaker 1: to be a sense of greater value in those

268
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:03,987
Speaker 1: kinds of connections and experiences.

269
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,157
Speaker 1: Value, purpose meaning, gravitas, value and

270
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:08,140
Speaker 1: those kinds of connections and experiences,

271
00:15:11,463 --> 00:15:12,304
Speaker 1: value, purpose meaning, gravitas, sense of

272
00:15:12,324 --> 00:15:13,946
Speaker 1: this means something of value.

273
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:15,008
Speaker 1: This is very important.

274
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:18,092
Speaker 1: This kind of feeling gives the experience

275
00:15:18,112 --> 00:15:25,681
Speaker 1: of being alive value and meaning, which is

276
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:27,791
Speaker 1: so important in the human experience.

277
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:31,327
Speaker 1: Experience value now this when we go deeper

278
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,224
Speaker 1: than that, the realm of the self, of the

279
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:37,108
Speaker 1: true self that spiritual realizers refer to

280
00:15:37,128 --> 00:15:39,292
Speaker 1: as the true self, that's the realm of

281
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:44,971
Speaker 1: eternity consciousness, of non-dual

282
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:46,093
Speaker 1: eternity consciousness.

283
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,994
Speaker 1: So the deepest dimension of the self, which

284
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:50,401
Speaker 1: is synonymous with the deepest dimension of

285
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:53,127
Speaker 1: reality itself, is a place where we

286
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:59,982
Speaker 1: experience the deepest quality and

287
00:16:00,022 --> 00:16:03,131
Speaker 1: experience of I-ness, of selfness, of

288
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:03,532
Speaker 1: I-ness.

289
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:06,487
Speaker 1: But at that level of depth it's completely

290
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,270
Speaker 1: impersonal.

291
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,527
Speaker 1: There's no unique characteristics or

292
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:13,813
Speaker 1: features to the true self.

293
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:17,266
Speaker 1: The true self is often referred to as the

294
00:16:17,287 --> 00:16:18,029
Speaker 1: ground of being.

295
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:21,269
Speaker 1: So it's an eternal ground that exists

296
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:23,980
Speaker 1: beyond time and beyond space, and beyond

297
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,649
Speaker 1: form and beyond conception.

298
00:16:27,942 --> 00:16:29,727
Speaker 1: But it's a place where you and I experience

299
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,264
Speaker 1: the fullest, deepest and most profound

300
00:16:33,324 --> 00:16:36,632
Speaker 1: experience of conscious existence.

301
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:40,025
Speaker 1: But at that level we experience ourself as

302
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,950
Speaker 1: existing eternally for eternity.

303
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:46,998
Speaker 1: It's a place where our awareness is

304
00:16:47,018 --> 00:16:48,040
Speaker 1: absolute, existing eternally for eternity.

305
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,965
Speaker 1: It's a place where awareness is absolute

306
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:52,231
Speaker 1: and existence is, as I was saying, eternal,

307
00:16:53,624 --> 00:16:55,480
Speaker 1: and it is absolutely and totally unrelated

308
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,764
Speaker 1: to any kind of relative experience that

309
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:03,106
Speaker 1: your soul or that your ego has in any other

310
00:17:03,126 --> 00:17:09,498
Speaker 1: kind of context or that your ego has in any

311
00:17:09,518 --> 00:17:10,020
Speaker 1: other kind of context.

312
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,544
Speaker 1: So we have the ego, positive and negative.

313
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:16,841
Speaker 1: We have the soul, we have the true self Now,

314
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:21,974
Speaker 1: the soul, which is, as I've been saying,

315
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,148
Speaker 1: which is the deepest part of the yourself

316
00:17:25,188 --> 00:17:25,589
Speaker 1: and myself.

317
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,392
Speaker 1: That's still personal.

318
00:17:27,141 --> 00:17:30,281
Speaker 1: It's where we experience our deepest, our

319
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:34,521
Speaker 1: deeper and more significant feelings and

320
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:40,269
Speaker 1: preferences and fears and yearnings and

321
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:40,771
Speaker 1: values.

322
00:17:46,562 --> 00:17:52,108
Speaker 1: What we experience in our soul depends upon

323
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:57,347
Speaker 1: our level of consciousness development on

324
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:59,362
Speaker 1: one hand, and on the other hand, it depends

325
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:02,461
Speaker 1: on what we hold as being most dear or the

326
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:09,137
Speaker 1: greatest value to us hold as being most

327
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:10,020
Speaker 1: dear and the greatest value to us.

328
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,843
Speaker 1: So in integral philosophy they had some

329
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,362
Speaker 1: basic, basic distinctions in terms of the

330
00:18:14,422 --> 00:18:16,503
Speaker 1: evolutionary stages that the self goes

331
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:19,525
Speaker 1: through, and we'll just go through the most

332
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:22,246
Speaker 1: basic ones for the sake of the talk on the

333
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:23,821
Speaker 1: everything here.

334
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:24,925
Speaker 1: It's tonight, where you are might be

335
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:30,811
Speaker 1: morning, but the lowest level is called

336
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:35,285
Speaker 1: egocentric and at the egocentric level is

337
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,746
Speaker 1: the consciousness of the small child, of

338
00:18:38,766 --> 00:18:43,147
Speaker 1: the baby, who is completely identified with

339
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,452
Speaker 1: his or her biological impulses, his or her

340
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:48,105
Speaker 1: biological impulses, his or her fears and

341
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:48,607
Speaker 1: desires.

342
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:52,261
Speaker 1: It's a state of uncontained, absolute

343
00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:53,828
Speaker 1: narcissism and self-concern.

344
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:02,164
Speaker 1: It's a place we all start from and a place

345
00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:04,651
Speaker 1: some of us, hopefully, will graduate from

346
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:08,307
Speaker 1: at some point in our evolutionary ascent,

347
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:12,942
Speaker 1: but some people never do so.

348
00:19:14,427 --> 00:19:19,486
Speaker 1: Egocentric, the next stage of the

349
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:22,012
Speaker 1: self-development is called ethnocentric

350
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:24,113
Speaker 1: development.

351
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:25,561
Speaker 1: It's called ethnocentric and at the

352
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,443
Speaker 1: ethnocentric level we identify very much

353
00:19:26,483 --> 00:19:30,803
Speaker 1: with our bloodline, with our family and our

354
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:31,264
Speaker 1: tribe.

355
00:19:31,986 --> 00:19:33,110
Speaker 1: It's tribal consciousness.

356
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,867
Speaker 1: That's where our self sense is very

357
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:42,967
Speaker 1: intensely identified with our clan, with

358
00:19:43,028 --> 00:19:46,085
Speaker 1: our tribe, with our family, that kind of

359
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:46,848
Speaker 1: blood belonging.

360
00:19:51,040 --> 00:20:05,427
Speaker 1: And next level is world-centric, which is a

361
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:06,792
Speaker 1: very high level of consciousness

362
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:09,601
Speaker 1: development, which is considered to be the

363
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,123
Speaker 1: leading edge in the world today, which is

364
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:17,295
Speaker 1: the identity, which is the identification,

365
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,008
Speaker 1: the universal nature of being a human being.

366
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,905
Speaker 1: I see myself first and foremost as a human

367
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:26,371
Speaker 1: being, as a member of the human family.

368
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,870
Speaker 1: So an individual at a world-centric,

369
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:39,301
Speaker 1: universal human level of development will

370
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,015
Speaker 1: see all human beings as his brothers and

371
00:20:42,056 --> 00:20:42,500
Speaker 1: his sisters.

372
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:46,070
Speaker 1: And the highest level, the one level beyond

373
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,795
Speaker 1: that which is the goal that all spiritual

374
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:53,670
Speaker 1: seekers after enlightenment yearn for and

375
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,227
Speaker 1: work towards, is called cosmocentric.

376
00:20:57,702 --> 00:20:59,419
Speaker 1: The cosmocentric level is when we identify

377
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:03,321
Speaker 1: with the evolutionary process itself as a

378
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:04,366
Speaker 1: source of our self-sense.

379
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,226
Speaker 1: I am the energy and intelligence that

380
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:09,362
Speaker 1: created the universe, bearing witness to

381
00:21:09,423 --> 00:21:10,928
Speaker 1: itself and awakening to itself through the

382
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:14,470
Speaker 1: body, mind, personality of Andrew or any

383
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:14,951
Speaker 1: one of you.

384
00:21:16,762 --> 00:21:19,212
Speaker 1: So we have these basic, simple distinctions

385
00:21:19,252 --> 00:21:19,392
Speaker 1: here.

386
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:22,116
Speaker 1: There are more distinctions, but I'm trying

387
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:24,084
Speaker 1: to keep it very simple because of the point

388
00:21:24,124 --> 00:21:25,650
Speaker 1: I want to make in this talk.

389
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,489
Speaker 1: So we have egocentric, ethnocentric

390
00:21:31,671 --> 00:21:33,922
Speaker 1: identifying with the clan and the bloodline,

391
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:40,260
Speaker 1: world-centric, universal, human and

392
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,560
Speaker 1: cosmocentric identification with the

393
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,851
Speaker 1: evolutionary principle itself and

394
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:48,417
Speaker 1: Cosmocentric Identification with the

395
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:49,619
Speaker 1: Evolutionary Principle itself.

396
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,526
Speaker 1: Now, the fundamental point I want to make

397
00:21:53,586 --> 00:21:55,129
Speaker 1: is that what I'm calling the soul here,

398
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:57,653
Speaker 1: what I'm keep on referring to as the soul,

399
00:21:57,673 --> 00:22:02,561
Speaker 1: this very, this deepest part of the self

400
00:22:02,581 --> 00:22:03,422
Speaker 1: that's still personal, where we have these

401
00:22:03,442 --> 00:22:05,925
Speaker 1: very powerful and profound emotions that

402
00:22:05,945 --> 00:22:09,750
Speaker 1: carry with them a great sense of importance

403
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:12,975
Speaker 1: and gravitas and significance.

404
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,667
Speaker 1: What you will feel in your soul as being

405
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:25,991
Speaker 1: that of the greatest importance depends

406
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,059
Speaker 1: upon which state of consciousness you are

407
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:29,420
Speaker 1: resting in.

408
00:22:29,922 --> 00:22:35,510
Speaker 1: So if you are, if you're at an ethnocentric

409
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:38,944
Speaker 1: stage of development where your primary

410
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:40,690
Speaker 1: identification is with your family or your

411
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:47,840
Speaker 1: tribe or your blood group, your clan, the

412
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,844
Speaker 1: deepest feelings that you'll experience in

413
00:22:49,864 --> 00:22:52,670
Speaker 1: your soul, your soul felt emotions, the

414
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,794
Speaker 1: strongest emotions positive and negative

415
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,082
Speaker 1: place where you experience the most

416
00:22:57,102 --> 00:23:04,493
Speaker 1: gravitas emotionally, will stem from your

417
00:23:04,793 --> 00:23:06,436
Speaker 1: will, stem from that level of development.

418
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,428
Speaker 1: So your strongest feelings and your soul

419
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,301
Speaker 1: will relate to your identification with

420
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:13,102
Speaker 1: being part of a particular tribe or a

421
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:17,626
Speaker 1: particular family and your strongest

422
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,941
Speaker 1: emotions are going to be very related to

423
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:20,986
Speaker 1: that stage of development.

424
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:24,866
Speaker 1: And we know, when people start to feel

425
00:23:24,907 --> 00:23:27,345
Speaker 1: strong feelings in their soul, they're

426
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:30,282
Speaker 1: capable of great heroism in one hand and

427
00:23:30,302 --> 00:23:32,028
Speaker 1: great evil on the other.

428
00:23:35,263 --> 00:23:37,389
Speaker 1: Because when we feel strong emotions in our

429
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:40,981
Speaker 1: soul, because it's coming from our soul, we

430
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:45,134
Speaker 1: tend to never doubt the inherent value and

431
00:23:45,254 --> 00:23:46,698
Speaker 1: what we imagine as the inherent

432
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:49,716
Speaker 1: truthfulness of what we're experiencing,

433
00:23:49,756 --> 00:23:51,244
Speaker 1: because the feelings are so strong at that

434
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:54,997
Speaker 1: level, we feel these feelings so strongly

435
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,385
Speaker 1: at that level that we feel this is truth.

436
00:24:01,827 --> 00:24:03,218
Speaker 1: That's why when we meet somebody that we

437
00:24:03,238 --> 00:24:12,055
Speaker 1: consider to be our soulmate, it's so

438
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,921
Speaker 1: powerful, I have no doubt I've been waiting

439
00:24:13,942 --> 00:24:16,026
Speaker 1: for you for a hundred lifetimes.

440
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:17,509
Speaker 1: Maybe it's true, maybe it's not true, but

441
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:19,853
Speaker 1: because we feel it so intensely in our soul,

442
00:24:24,436 --> 00:24:25,160
Speaker 1: we have no doubt that it's true.

443
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,585
Speaker 1: So egocentric, ethnocentric, so it's the

444
00:24:27,626 --> 00:24:32,900
Speaker 1: same thing with world-centric, universal

445
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,065
Speaker 1: human values and feelings.

446
00:24:43,675 --> 00:24:45,439
Speaker 1: A lot of people, for very noble reasons,

447
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:52,552
Speaker 1: feel at the level of their soul how

448
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:53,996
Speaker 1: important it is that there's human rights

449
00:24:54,036 --> 00:25:02,246
Speaker 1: and fairness and justice in this world and

450
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:11,198
Speaker 1: world and the flourishing of liberal

451
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:15,104
Speaker 1: democracies and the freedom for women and

452
00:25:15,284 --> 00:25:15,825
Speaker 1: oppressed peoples.

453
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:16,286
Speaker 1: Everywhere.

454
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:19,471
Speaker 1: It comes to the end of racism and sexism

455
00:25:22,777 --> 00:25:27,346
Speaker 1: and patriarchy and so many things, because

456
00:25:27,366 --> 00:25:30,333
Speaker 1: we recognize that all human beings are part

457
00:25:30,373 --> 00:25:31,155
Speaker 1: of one species.

458
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:32,525
Speaker 1: We're all brothers and sisters and

459
00:25:32,545 --> 00:25:38,357
Speaker 1: therefore we need to make this world a fair

460
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:38,738
Speaker 1: place.

461
00:25:41,587 --> 00:25:43,754
Speaker 1: But some people feel that in their soul

462
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:50,726
Speaker 1: this is a soul felt conviction, not

463
00:25:50,746 --> 00:25:52,486
Speaker 1: something that is just believed and

464
00:25:52,506 --> 00:25:53,490
Speaker 1: understood with the mind.

465
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:55,167
Speaker 1: It's a soul level.

466
00:25:55,207 --> 00:26:06,145
Speaker 1: It's a soul felt conviction and when you

467
00:26:06,186 --> 00:26:07,266
Speaker 1: feel something like that so strongly in

468
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,508
Speaker 1: your soul, it's something you might be

469
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:10,269
Speaker 1: willing to die for and fight for.

470
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:19,217
Speaker 1: It's not a judgment, I'm just trying.

471
00:26:19,237 --> 00:26:20,378
Speaker 1: And then we go from world-centric to

472
00:26:20,418 --> 00:26:21,158
Speaker 1: Cosmic-centric.

473
00:26:26,045 --> 00:26:30,377
Speaker 1: So when you which is a very rare level of

474
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:33,205
Speaker 1: attainment I am the energy and intelligence

475
00:26:33,265 --> 00:26:35,513
Speaker 1: that created the universe, bearing witness

476
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:36,636
Speaker 1: to itself through the body, mind and

477
00:26:36,656 --> 00:26:41,509
Speaker 1: personality of each and every one of us,

478
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:47,565
Speaker 1: that's when we relate to and identify with

479
00:26:47,585 --> 00:26:50,935
Speaker 1: the evolutionary process from our souls.

480
00:26:53,465 --> 00:26:54,249
Speaker 1: That's when it becomes a.

481
00:26:57,525 --> 00:27:00,835
Speaker 1: There's a realness about that stage of

482
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:03,749
Speaker 1: development that becomes different because

483
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:05,114
Speaker 1: we feel it in our souls.

484
00:27:15,347 --> 00:27:17,394
Speaker 1: So one of the points I wanted to make was

485
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:26,990
Speaker 1: that many of us relate to our experience,

486
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:27,773
Speaker 1: to our intellects.

487
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,868
Speaker 1: We're capable of so much understanding.

488
00:27:32,908 --> 00:27:36,654
Speaker 1: We understand egocentrism or narcissism.

489
00:27:36,674 --> 00:27:41,916
Speaker 1: We understand ethnocentric, tribal

490
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:46,064
Speaker 1: perspectives and feelings.

491
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:53,429
Speaker 1: At least to a point we recognize feelings

492
00:27:53,489 --> 00:27:57,489
Speaker 1: of universality, the universal nature of

493
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:03,888
Speaker 1: being human, which is a world-centric

494
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:06,276
Speaker 1: perspective, and world-centric feelings,

495
00:28:11,787 --> 00:28:12,832
Speaker 1: and then there's cosmocentric.

496
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:16,611
Speaker 1: So what I'm saying is we can understand

497
00:28:16,631 --> 00:28:20,886
Speaker 1: these distinctions with our intellects, we

498
00:28:20,906 --> 00:28:22,250
Speaker 1: can appreciate them intellectually,

499
00:28:23,072 --> 00:28:24,917
Speaker 1: metaphorically, at a level of abstraction.

500
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:27,651
Speaker 1: And then there's the level of actual

501
00:28:27,692 --> 00:28:31,035
Speaker 1: feeling, of deep soul level feeling.

502
00:28:32,765 --> 00:28:34,151
Speaker 1: And one of the points I wanted to make was

503
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:38,150
Speaker 1: that the when we experience these

504
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,984
Speaker 1: distinctions at a soul level, we no longer

505
00:28:41,024 --> 00:28:42,391
Speaker 1: experience, we know that we're not just

506
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:43,818
Speaker 1: understanding these distinctions at a soul

507
00:28:43,838 --> 00:28:44,642
Speaker 1: level, we're not just understanding these

508
00:28:44,663 --> 00:28:47,510
Speaker 1: distinctions at a level of mind and mental

509
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,793
Speaker 1: or intellectual abstraction, but we're

510
00:28:48,813 --> 00:28:51,806
Speaker 1: understanding them with our gut, with our

511
00:28:51,886 --> 00:28:55,031
Speaker 1: soul, the deepest nature of ourself.

512
00:28:59,178 --> 00:29:02,945
Speaker 1: And because, basically, what I'm speaking

513
00:29:02,965 --> 00:29:04,290
Speaker 1: about has to do with what is it that we

514
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,908
Speaker 1: care about the most, what is it that you

515
00:29:05,928 --> 00:29:07,428
Speaker 1: care about the most, what is it that I care

516
00:29:07,468 --> 00:29:08,031
Speaker 1: about the most?

517
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,811
Speaker 1: Because what we care about the most will be

518
00:29:16,851 --> 00:29:20,116
Speaker 1: reflected in our soul level, in this

519
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:21,499
Speaker 1: experience we're having at the level of our

520
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:21,940
Speaker 1: souls.

521
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:26,093
Speaker 1: So what do you really care about the most?

522
00:29:27,505 --> 00:29:28,730
Speaker 1: What you care about the most is what you

523
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:49,126
Speaker 1: feel in your soul, and a big part of the

524
00:29:49,147 --> 00:29:50,850
Speaker 1: higher and more profound levels of

525
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,753
Speaker 1: spiritual transformation has to do with, I

526
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:53,597
Speaker 1: believe, the evolution of our capacity to

527
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:57,234
Speaker 1: care about higher matters at the level of

528
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:57,836
Speaker 1: our souls.

529
00:30:01,447 --> 00:30:04,395
Speaker 1: To repeat, I believe that a very

530
00:30:04,415 --> 00:30:07,101
Speaker 1: significant part of what higher spiritual

531
00:30:07,142 --> 00:30:09,433
Speaker 1: development is about is learning how to

532
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:12,214
Speaker 1: care, learning what it means to deeply care,

533
00:30:13,473 --> 00:30:14,701
Speaker 1: in this case about the evolution of

534
00:30:14,722 --> 00:30:18,909
Speaker 1: consciousness, not from your mind, not

535
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:22,030
Speaker 1: appreciating that this would be a very good

536
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,428
Speaker 1: idea and makes reasonable sense, but that

537
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:30,436
Speaker 1: you begin to care because your soul has

538
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:33,987
Speaker 1: awakened to that level of consciousness, to

539
00:30:34,027 --> 00:30:35,272
Speaker 1: its significance, and then you begin to

540
00:30:35,312 --> 00:30:37,993
Speaker 1: care, beyond what your mind may think from

541
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:42,013
Speaker 1: time to time, about the evolution of

542
00:30:42,053 --> 00:30:44,146
Speaker 1: consciousness for its own sake, because

543
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,413
Speaker 1: your soul has awakened to that level of

544
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:47,055
Speaker 1: development.

545
00:30:48,887 --> 00:30:50,332
Speaker 1: So the soul has to do with what do you care

546
00:30:50,372 --> 00:30:51,014
Speaker 1: about the most?

547
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:58,786
Speaker 1: Where are you rooted in your, your deepest,

548
00:30:59,387 --> 00:31:01,590
Speaker 1: your deepest preferences?

549
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,029
Speaker 1: Now, when we look at that question

550
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,277
Speaker 1: superficially, we find that for most people

551
00:31:12,297 --> 00:31:15,710
Speaker 1: it's egoic self-concern, survival at lower

552
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,297
Speaker 1: levels and beyond survival.

553
00:31:18,405 --> 00:31:21,595
Speaker 1: It has to do with egocentric, unfortunately

554
00:31:21,905 --> 00:31:26,147
Speaker 1: often materialistic survival, materialistic

555
00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:29,175
Speaker 1: self-concern and narcissistic self-concern,

556
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:41,228
Speaker 1: not an awakened souls feeling of

557
00:31:41,308 --> 00:31:44,467
Speaker 1: overwhelming value about the nature and the

558
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:45,510
Speaker 1: nature and inherent meaning of

559
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:49,880
Speaker 1: self-existence, the significance of

560
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:53,352
Speaker 1: consciousness and the significance of the

561
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,758
Speaker 1: evolution of the cosmos.

562
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:00,353
Speaker 1: What are you living for?

563
00:32:04,646 --> 00:32:07,949
Speaker 1: Because we can't really live for spirit and

564
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:11,130
Speaker 1: for these higher spiritual values unless we

565
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,775
Speaker 1: have awakened, at the level of the soul,

566
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:14,673
Speaker 1: these higher principles.

567
00:32:21,527 --> 00:32:47,821
Speaker 1: So the question I'm asking is where is any

568
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,021
Speaker 1: one of us at the level people?

569
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:50,663
Speaker 1: Our soul is very much related to

570
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:01,640
Speaker 1: materialistic concerns and narcissistic

571
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:07,091
Speaker 1: concerns, ethnocentric concerns.

572
00:33:12,988 --> 00:33:14,539
Speaker 1: But when your soul is related to these

573
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,772
Speaker 1: deeper dimensions of the self and deeper

574
00:33:17,812 --> 00:33:20,566
Speaker 1: dimensions of reality, this is when

575
00:33:22,511 --> 00:33:24,456
Speaker 1: spiritual evolution begins to happen for

576
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:24,757
Speaker 1: real.

577
00:33:25,766 --> 00:33:28,745
Speaker 1: It's when you become a truly transformed

578
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:31,214
Speaker 1: sentient being.

579
00:33:38,207 --> 00:33:40,397
Speaker 1: That's when the soul begins to, when the

580
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:46,011
Speaker 1: soul literally begins to identify itself

581
00:33:46,051 --> 00:33:54,327
Speaker 1: with unqualified spirit and something

582
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:57,374
Speaker 1: really changes in each and every one of us

583
00:33:58,717 --> 00:33:59,438
Speaker 1: at the deepest level.

584
00:33:59,946 --> 00:34:03,314
Speaker 1: It's when your soul gets so drenched in the

585
00:34:03,354 --> 00:34:05,358
Speaker 1: consciousness of eternity, for example,

586
00:34:07,225 --> 00:34:08,951
Speaker 1: that it's something you can't forget, you

587
00:34:08,972 --> 00:34:09,634
Speaker 1: can't turn away from.

588
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:12,053
Speaker 1: You've been so deeply touched that your

589
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:16,006
Speaker 1: soul is now awakened to eternity and it's

590
00:34:16,026 --> 00:34:17,172
Speaker 1: something that your soul knows about.

591
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:18,752
Speaker 1: Now your soul knows about eternity.

592
00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:19,629
Speaker 1: It's not that your ego had a great

593
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:20,513
Speaker 1: experience that it remembers, but it's

594
00:34:20,533 --> 00:34:21,256
Speaker 1: something that your soul had a great

595
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:22,562
Speaker 1: experience that it remembers, but it's

596
00:34:22,582 --> 00:34:23,486
Speaker 1: something that you know, it's something

597
00:34:23,506 --> 00:34:26,949
Speaker 1: that your soul knows and your soul the soul,

598
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:27,591
Speaker 1: never forgets.

599
00:34:51,705 --> 00:34:52,788
Speaker 1: The soul is the most important part of each

600
00:34:52,828 --> 00:34:53,269
Speaker 1: and every one of us.

601
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:57,058
Speaker 1: The soul is the source of our integrity, or

602
00:34:57,078 --> 00:34:58,040
Speaker 1: lack of integrity.

603
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:03,358
Speaker 1: The soul is where we find our capacity for

604
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,105
Speaker 1: wholeness and integration.

605
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:10,814
Speaker 1: Deep kindness, unselfish deep kindness,

606
00:35:13,353 --> 00:35:31,867
Speaker 1: love, loyalty, care, selflessness or not, I

607
00:35:31,907 --> 00:35:33,696
Speaker 1: believe it's the soul, it's that dimension

608
00:35:33,777 --> 00:35:35,290
Speaker 1: of ourselves where we have that rude

609
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:35,832
Speaker 1: awakening.

610
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:42,151
Speaker 1: Rude awakening is when you get a glimpse of

611
00:35:42,171 --> 00:35:44,749
Speaker 1: the totality of reality, whatever way it

612
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:47,160
Speaker 1: happens, and you glimpse, for maybe an

613
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:50,683
Speaker 1: instant, where you're really at in

614
00:35:50,723 --> 00:35:52,070
Speaker 1: relationship to the experience of being

615
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:52,331
Speaker 1: human.

616
00:35:53,347 --> 00:35:56,136
Speaker 1: For a moment, you glimpse your true motives,

617
00:35:59,248 --> 00:36:00,353
Speaker 1: and it may be a rude awakening.

618
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:03,872
Speaker 1: You might find out that you're not as true,

619
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:07,531
Speaker 1: authentic and pure, well-meaning as you may

620
00:36:07,571 --> 00:36:10,331
Speaker 1: imagine yourself to be, or you may find

621
00:36:10,352 --> 00:36:10,853
Speaker 1: that you are.

622
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:16,681
Speaker 1: But the place you find it, the place within

623
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:18,325
Speaker 1: yourself that you find out the answers to

624
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,327
Speaker 1: these kinds of questions, is in your soul.

625
00:36:42,405 --> 00:36:42,885
Speaker 1: So, for example, when you can hear some

626
00:36:42,805 --> 00:36:43,504
Speaker 1: people speak about their spiritual

627
00:36:43,424 --> 00:36:45,309
Speaker 1: experiences, some people will speak, maybe

628
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:48,559
Speaker 1: in a very articulate and intellectually

629
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:51,126
Speaker 1: coherent way, about higher states and

630
00:36:51,307 --> 00:36:52,930
Speaker 1: higher state experiences that they may have

631
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:57,387
Speaker 1: had, but have they been touched at the

632
00:36:57,447 --> 00:36:59,831
Speaker 1: level of the soul by those experiences or

633
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:07,844
Speaker 1: has it merely been an interesting process

634
00:37:07,864 --> 00:37:09,188
Speaker 1: that they went through that still leaves

635
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,774
Speaker 1: them fundamentally unchanged?

636
00:37:13,026 --> 00:37:17,133
Speaker 1: When we're touched at the level of our soul,

637
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:20,399
Speaker 1: it's impossible for us to remain unchanged.

638
00:37:28,822 --> 00:37:30,165
Speaker 1: It's impossible for us to remain unchanged.

639
00:37:30,725 --> 00:37:31,397
Speaker 1: And the longer that I live and the longer

640
00:37:31,345 --> 00:37:32,197
Speaker 1: that I teach and the more experience I have,

641
00:37:32,197 --> 00:37:33,940
Speaker 1: I think that the development of the soul,

642
00:37:34,065 --> 00:37:36,926
Speaker 1: the conscious development of the soul, the

643
00:37:36,946 --> 00:37:40,891
Speaker 1: conscious cultivation of the soul, might be

644
00:37:40,911 --> 00:37:42,375
Speaker 1: the most important part of spiritual

645
00:37:42,435 --> 00:37:45,252
Speaker 1: practice and being involved in the

646
00:37:45,272 --> 00:37:46,115
Speaker 1: spiritual process.

647
00:37:48,245 --> 00:37:50,130
Speaker 1: Because, as to repeat what I said a few

648
00:37:50,171 --> 00:37:52,096
Speaker 1: minutes ago, because the soul is the place

649
00:37:52,116 --> 00:37:59,113
Speaker 1: where we find our capacity, or lack of

650
00:37:59,254 --> 00:38:02,337
Speaker 1: capacity, for authenticity, deep

651
00:38:02,357 --> 00:38:10,907
Speaker 1: trustworthiness, gravitas and

652
00:38:10,927 --> 00:38:13,676
Speaker 1: single-pointedness in relationship to

653
00:38:15,161 --> 00:38:16,848
Speaker 1: consciousness development and soul

654
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:17,330
Speaker 1: development.

655
00:38:22,546 --> 00:38:24,732
Speaker 1: Now, in Western postmodern culture, the

656
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:26,296
Speaker 1: soul is not something we speak about that

657
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:33,287
Speaker 1: often, and often when I hear people speak

658
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:35,190
Speaker 1: about the soul in spiritual context

659
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,013
Speaker 1: generally, to make a gross generalization

660
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:40,156
Speaker 1: it often seems to have more to do with the

661
00:38:40,176 --> 00:38:44,081
Speaker 1: ego's deeper feelings than anything else.

662
00:38:51,565 --> 00:38:53,508
Speaker 1: The soul is that part of ourself in which

663
00:38:53,548 --> 00:39:03,361
Speaker 1: we glimpse what a deadly serious matter.

664
00:39:03,646 --> 00:39:06,351
Speaker 1: The gift of life is the gift of conscious

665
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:12,382
Speaker 1: life, the gift of life that is consciously

666
00:39:12,422 --> 00:39:13,588
Speaker 1: experienced in the context of

667
00:39:13,648 --> 00:39:14,793
Speaker 1: self-effective awareness.

668
00:39:17,006 --> 00:39:22,936
Speaker 1: The soul is the place where we realize this

669
00:39:22,977 --> 00:39:23,638
Speaker 1: is not a game.

670
00:39:23,745 --> 00:39:25,089
Speaker 1: We're not going to get any second chances,

671
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:30,007
Speaker 1: necessarily, and everything counts.

672
00:39:30,028 --> 00:39:33,716
Speaker 1: The karma is real, there's no way out,

673
00:39:33,756 --> 00:39:34,578
Speaker 1: there's no escape.

674
00:39:36,488 --> 00:39:37,853
Speaker 1: There's no way out, there's no escape.

675
00:39:38,887 --> 00:39:42,475
Speaker 1: And it's where we awaken to this chakra

676
00:39:42,515 --> 00:39:45,109
Speaker 1: recognition that this is it, when, always,

677
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:48,171
Speaker 1: now, in the present moment, that this is

678
00:39:48,231 --> 00:39:50,986
Speaker 1: really it, that this really counts, that

679
00:39:51,006 --> 00:39:52,532
Speaker 1: all the important choices we make really

680
00:39:52,592 --> 00:39:57,973
Speaker 1: count, and there's no extricating ourselves

681
00:39:58,033 --> 00:40:01,695
Speaker 1: from a from karmic momentum.

682
00:40:03,725 --> 00:40:06,514
Speaker 1: We're all part and parcel of a very complex

683
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,397
Speaker 1: process of karmic momentum.

684
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:09,303
Speaker 1: We're all part and parcel of a very complex

685
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:09,985
Speaker 1: process of karmic momentum.

686
00:40:11,005 --> 00:40:14,185
Speaker 1: We can't disentangle ourselves from it, but

687
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:16,190
Speaker 1: we can, through spiritual practice,

688
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:24,417
Speaker 1: cultivate the capacity to consciously add

689
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:27,553
Speaker 1: that which is most positive to the

690
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:34,796
Speaker 1: complexity of the karmic process that we

691
00:40:34,896 --> 00:40:36,579
Speaker 1: are entangled in.

692
00:40:37,907 --> 00:40:40,535
Speaker 1: We can, through our own focused intention,

693
00:40:44,455 --> 00:40:45,980
Speaker 1: bring some genuine positivity to the

694
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,244
Speaker 1: process and, through our own focused

695
00:40:47,264 --> 00:40:50,794
Speaker 1: intention, bring some genuine positivity to

696
00:40:50,814 --> 00:40:51,316
Speaker 1: the process.

697
00:40:51,336 --> 00:40:56,837
Speaker 1: That's real, that will affect the process

698
00:40:56,858 --> 00:40:58,348
Speaker 1: as a whole in its own way, because a lot of

699
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,277
Speaker 1: us like to think of ourselves as somehow

700
00:40:59,297 --> 00:41:01,129
Speaker 1: not responsible and somehow that we're

701
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,925
Speaker 1: standing outside this vast cosmic process

702
00:41:04,025 --> 00:41:08,092
Speaker 1: watching as kind of observers observers and

703
00:41:08,172 --> 00:41:11,898
Speaker 1: victims, not co-creators.

704
00:41:13,165 --> 00:41:14,709
Speaker 1: But when we wake up, in the way that I've

705
00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:16,374
Speaker 1: been describing, we realize that we're

706
00:41:16,394 --> 00:41:17,988
Speaker 1: always co-creators, whether we're conscious

707
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:18,771
Speaker 1: of it or not.

708
00:41:21,785 --> 00:41:22,709
Speaker 1: We're always co-creators, whether we're

709
00:41:22,729 --> 00:41:23,553
Speaker 1: conscious of it or not.

710
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:26,272
Speaker 1: And when you really begin to wake up, you

711
00:41:26,292 --> 00:41:27,556
Speaker 1: realize number one, that that's true,

712
00:41:27,905 --> 00:41:30,451
Speaker 1: there's no time off or days off or time out.

713
00:41:31,393 --> 00:41:36,001
Speaker 1: Everything counts, and that the state of

714
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:38,712
Speaker 1: consciousness and the state of development

715
00:41:38,732 --> 00:41:42,849
Speaker 1: of our souls is all important because that

716
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:45,628
Speaker 1: will indicate the ways in which we're going

717
00:41:45,648 --> 00:41:48,792
Speaker 1: to be able to contribute positively or not

718
00:41:49,636 --> 00:41:52,709
Speaker 1: to this cosmic unfolding that we're part

719
00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:55,897
Speaker 1: and parcel of always.

720
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,553
Speaker 1: So in this context, we can think about the

721
00:42:10,573 --> 00:42:11,659
Speaker 1: process in terms of spiritual practice and

722
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:13,907
Speaker 1: purification, the cultivation of

723
00:42:14,228 --> 00:42:17,306
Speaker 1: purification and integration of higher

724
00:42:17,346 --> 00:42:20,376
Speaker 1: wholeness and of a higher motivation

725
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,177
Speaker 1: Ultimately not for our own sake, not for

726
00:42:22,076 --> 00:42:23,449
Speaker 1: our own liberation, ultimately not for our

727
00:42:23,348 --> 00:42:26,268
Speaker 1: own sake, not for our own liberation, not

728
00:42:26,308 --> 00:42:29,310
Speaker 1: for our own soul salvation and so that

729
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:32,312
Speaker 1: we'll be able to contribute that which is

730
00:42:34,238 --> 00:42:36,185
Speaker 1: unimaginably wholesome and purely positive

731
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:44,596
Speaker 1: to this unconscious hurricane that is the

732
00:42:44,636 --> 00:42:46,286
Speaker 1: complexity of this cosmic process that

733
00:42:46,306 --> 00:42:47,030
Speaker 1: we're in the midst of.

734
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:50,751
Speaker 1: There's so much positivity that we can

735
00:42:50,771 --> 00:42:53,049
Speaker 1: bring to this If we're willing to make the

736
00:42:53,089 --> 00:42:55,232
Speaker 1: effort to do so and to sacrifice ourselves,

737
00:42:56,545 --> 00:42:59,068
Speaker 1: to sacrifice our egos, because the ego

738
00:42:59,108 --> 00:43:00,133
Speaker 1: always has another agenda.

739
00:43:00,986 --> 00:43:02,452
Speaker 1: I want to do this and I want to do that

740
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:03,433
Speaker 1: because it's all for me, because the ego

741
00:43:03,453 --> 00:43:03,957
Speaker 1: always has another agenda.

742
00:43:03,977 --> 00:43:04,885
Speaker 1: I want to do this and I want to do that

743
00:43:05,806 --> 00:43:06,287
Speaker 1: Because it's all for me.

744
00:43:06,969 --> 00:43:08,554
Speaker 1: I want to do this and I want to do that.

745
00:43:18,877 --> 00:43:19,739
Speaker 1: The ego almost always has another agenda in

746
00:43:19,759 --> 00:43:31,100
Speaker 1: mind, and when we begin to see ourselves

747
00:43:32,204 --> 00:43:33,628
Speaker 1: and when we can see ourselves and locate

748
00:43:33,689 --> 00:43:39,012
Speaker 1: ourselves in the midst of this chaos and

749
00:43:39,052 --> 00:43:42,929
Speaker 1: confusion, we begin to recognize how

750
00:43:43,009 --> 00:43:48,668
Speaker 1: important our contribution of as much

751
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:53,143
Speaker 1: positivity as possible is, not as a

752
00:43:53,203 --> 00:43:54,567
Speaker 1: secondary contribution, but as a

753
00:43:54,627 --> 00:43:56,462
Speaker 1: fundamental contribution, as our essential

754
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:00,701
Speaker 1: gift to the universe, if we have enough

755
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:03,404
Speaker 1: courage to do it.

756
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:25,377
Speaker 1: So is your soul fundamentally identified

757
00:44:25,437 --> 00:44:31,063
Speaker 1: with your ego and its fears and desires and

758
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:33,972
Speaker 1: grievances and frustrations and unresolved

759
00:44:33,992 --> 00:44:34,333
Speaker 1: trauma?

760
00:44:37,704 --> 00:44:40,972
Speaker 1: Is that what your soul is identified with?

761
00:44:44,802 --> 00:44:48,212
Speaker 1: Is your soul identified with your bloodline,

762
00:44:54,062 --> 00:45:01,344
Speaker 1: your biological identity and the profound

763
00:45:01,385 --> 00:45:05,003
Speaker 1: sense of self-importance, in the positive

764
00:45:05,043 --> 00:45:06,569
Speaker 1: sense, that that brings with it?

765
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,104
Speaker 1: Just think for a minute.

766
00:45:16,124 --> 00:45:29,221
Speaker 1: Where is your soul identified If you're

767
00:45:29,241 --> 00:45:31,388
Speaker 1: interested in enlightenment in a serious

768
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:33,054
Speaker 1: way, then that would mean that your soul is

769
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:38,169
Speaker 1: identified with eternity, that which is

770
00:45:38,229 --> 00:45:40,449
Speaker 1: birthless and deathless, timeless and

771
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:41,740
Speaker 1: formless, and beginningless and endless,

772
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:52,557
Speaker 1: and that's timeless and formless and

773
00:45:52,597 --> 00:45:54,260
Speaker 1: beginningless and endless.

774
00:46:01,073 --> 00:46:02,276
Speaker 1: Or is your soul identified with the

775
00:46:02,296 --> 00:46:04,100
Speaker 1: evolutionary impulse?

776
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,824
Speaker 1: God forces, the force of creativity as the

777
00:46:05,845 --> 00:46:17,664
Speaker 1: universe in the universe and in this

778
00:46:17,784 --> 00:46:18,225
Speaker 1: process?

779
00:46:18,265 --> 00:46:20,270
Speaker 1: It's very important and very helpful to

780
00:46:20,331 --> 00:46:22,802
Speaker 1: learn how to do to the practice of

781
00:46:23,243 --> 00:46:27,842
Speaker 1: contemplative inquiry, contemplative

782
00:46:27,882 --> 00:46:28,605
Speaker 1: self-scrutiny.

783
00:46:28,665 --> 00:46:33,044
Speaker 1: Contemplative inquiry for you and I do this

784
00:46:33,104 --> 00:46:39,755
Speaker 1: myself as often as possible, like every day

785
00:46:41,481 --> 00:46:43,828
Speaker 1: is to learn how to practice to discriminate

786
00:46:43,848 --> 00:46:50,067
Speaker 1: between the concerns of your ego and the

787
00:46:50,087 --> 00:46:58,704
Speaker 1: concerns of your soul, because the ego can

788
00:46:58,724 --> 00:47:01,082
Speaker 1: have very strong feelings, very strong

789
00:47:01,122 --> 00:47:02,748
Speaker 1: likes and dislikes and all kinds of

790
00:47:02,808 --> 00:47:10,121
Speaker 1: preferences, and they can be distracting,

791
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:15,426
Speaker 1: we all know.

792
00:47:15,446 --> 00:47:20,410
Speaker 1: But your soul feels things even more deeply

793
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:21,931
Speaker 1: than your ego does, as powerful as your

794
00:47:21,991 --> 00:47:23,092
Speaker 1: egoic feelings can be.

795
00:47:24,073 --> 00:47:28,557
Speaker 1: And are you aware, as you're going through

796
00:47:28,577 --> 00:47:33,482
Speaker 1: the ups and downs, of how the ego might

797
00:47:33,502 --> 00:47:34,205
Speaker 1: feel and how the soul might feel?

798
00:47:34,225 --> 00:47:37,899
Speaker 1: So are you aware of the difference between

799
00:47:37,919 --> 00:47:59,182
Speaker 1: the two, because the soul is always very

800
00:47:59,202 --> 00:48:08,877
Speaker 1: concerned with what you know and what you

801
00:48:08,897 --> 00:48:10,058
Speaker 1: feel is most important.

802
00:48:10,078 --> 00:48:11,481
Speaker 1: It's very important to understand that what

803
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:14,871
Speaker 1: I'm calling the true self, the grounded

804
00:48:14,911 --> 00:48:19,707
Speaker 1: being, doesn't have preferences.

805
00:48:22,581 --> 00:48:28,349
Speaker 1: It's free from all events or anything and

806
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:29,231
Speaker 1: everything that ever happens.

807
00:48:31,181 --> 00:48:33,022
Speaker 1: The true self is free from and not

808
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:34,127
Speaker 1: identified with, any of it.

809
00:48:38,681 --> 00:48:40,741
Speaker 1: That's why it's the awakened soul that has

810
00:48:40,762 --> 00:48:44,609
Speaker 1: to be our guide, because the true self is

811
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:53,155
Speaker 1: pure, unqualified, absolute is-ness.

812
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:04,990
Speaker 1: It doesn't make preferences, it doesn't

813
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:06,291
Speaker 1: make choices because it's always already

814
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:06,412
Speaker 1: free.

815
00:49:06,432 --> 00:49:07,913
Speaker 1: So a big part of spiritual practice is

816
00:49:07,953 --> 00:49:09,175
Speaker 1: learning how to distinguish between the

817
00:49:09,235 --> 00:49:13,782
Speaker 1: soul's feelings and preferences and the

818
00:49:13,882 --> 00:49:15,144
Speaker 1: ego's feelings and preferences.

819
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,184
Speaker 1: People who are living life from their soul

820
00:49:22,825 --> 00:49:26,373
Speaker 1: are much deeper people, much deeper beings.

821
00:49:31,446 --> 00:49:34,973
Speaker 1: They have more weight, ascension beings

822
00:49:36,761 --> 00:49:38,584
Speaker 1: because they're much more connected to

823
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:45,505
Speaker 1: depth and value and meaning and purpose and

824
00:49:45,526 --> 00:49:52,211
Speaker 1: the significance of history and karma and

825
00:49:52,252 --> 00:49:52,773
Speaker 1: direction.

826
00:50:00,661 --> 00:50:01,806
Speaker 1: So we don't want to swim around on the

827
00:50:01,826 --> 00:50:02,548
Speaker 1: surface of life.

828
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:11,639
Speaker 1: So we don't want to swim around on the

829
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:15,971
Speaker 1: surface of life Lost in the egos, fears and

830
00:50:16,052 --> 00:50:19,542
Speaker 1: desires, likes and dislikes, as so many

831
00:50:19,562 --> 00:50:21,824
Speaker 1: people do these days, lost, so deeply lost

832
00:50:21,884 --> 00:50:23,186
Speaker 1: and not even knowing that they're lost.

833
00:50:24,487 --> 00:50:26,349
Speaker 1: Is it worse to be lost or is it worse to be

834
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:27,170
Speaker 1: lost and not know it?

835
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,472
Speaker 1: I think it's worse to be lost and not know

836
00:50:29,492 --> 00:50:29,532
Speaker 1: it.

837
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:31,354
Speaker 1: If you're lost and you know you're lost,

838
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:33,256
Speaker 1: you're not completely lost.

839
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:37,941
Speaker 1: But if you're lost and you don't know

840
00:50:37,961 --> 00:50:45,713
Speaker 1: you're lost, then you're really lost.

841
00:50:45,733 --> 00:50:47,355
Speaker 1: And if you think you're lost and it scares

842
00:50:47,395 --> 00:50:49,207
Speaker 1: you, that's good.

843
00:50:50,665 --> 00:50:53,206
Speaker 1: Sometimes it's good to be scared of being

844
00:50:53,266 --> 00:50:57,801
Speaker 1: lost because it will help you to care about

845
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:58,521
Speaker 1: deeper matters.

846
00:51:18,616 --> 00:51:22,899
Speaker 1: So, as you meditate, as you practice in

847
00:51:22,939 --> 00:51:24,483
Speaker 1: self-inquiry, as you practice, as you

848
00:51:24,503 --> 00:51:25,989
Speaker 1: practice in self-inquiry, as you practice

849
00:51:26,029 --> 00:51:29,404
Speaker 1: contemplation, as you scoot in your own

850
00:51:29,444 --> 00:51:32,822
Speaker 1: internal thoughts and feelings, highs and

851
00:51:32,862 --> 00:51:38,830
Speaker 1: lows, ups and downs, try to find out where

852
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,333
Speaker 1: you're at in relationship to your soul.

853
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,087
Speaker 1: What is your soul that you care about?

854
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,406
Speaker 1: What is your soul focused on?

855
00:51:48,642 --> 00:51:50,789
Speaker 1: Where are you at in relationship to your

856
00:51:50,809 --> 00:51:51,090
Speaker 1: soul?

857
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,884
Speaker 1: Because it's my belief.

858
00:52:00,027 --> 00:52:01,363
Speaker 1: I can't prove this, but it's my belief that

859
00:52:01,403 --> 00:52:04,046
Speaker 1: the soul, as I said, is the metaphysical

860
00:52:04,167 --> 00:52:17,959
Speaker 1: organ in which there's continuity from life

861
00:52:17,979 --> 00:52:18,160
Speaker 1: to life.

862
00:52:18,681 --> 00:52:20,848
Speaker 1: I always ask people is there continuity in

863
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:25,362
Speaker 1: the material process of the evolving cosmos

864
00:52:25,482 --> 00:52:33,735
Speaker 1: cosmos is sorry is there continuity in the

865
00:52:35,445 --> 00:52:37,191
Speaker 1: in the evolution of the energy and matter

866
00:52:37,231 --> 00:52:39,538
Speaker 1: that make up the evolving universe?

867
00:52:39,558 --> 00:52:41,422
Speaker 1: Is there continuity from the, from the big

868
00:52:41,442 --> 00:52:42,344
Speaker 1: bang until now?

869
00:52:42,905 --> 00:52:43,627
Speaker 1: Is there continuity?

870
00:52:43,687 --> 00:52:46,092
Speaker 1: Is, is there continuity in the past 14

871
00:52:46,132 --> 00:52:49,367
Speaker 1: billion years of evolutionary becoming at

872
00:52:49,387 --> 00:52:50,371
Speaker 1: the level of matter and energy?

873
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,404
Speaker 1: And people would say yes, there's

874
00:52:51,424 --> 00:52:51,987
Speaker 1: continuity.

875
00:52:53,363 --> 00:52:54,774
Speaker 1: So if there's continuity at the level of

876
00:52:54,815 --> 00:52:56,485
Speaker 1: energy and matter for the last 14 billion

877
00:52:56,525 --> 00:53:00,309
Speaker 1: years, at the level of matter and energy,

878
00:53:02,341 --> 00:53:03,847
Speaker 1: which is considered to be the outside of

879
00:53:03,867 --> 00:53:05,994
Speaker 1: the universe, why would there not also be

880
00:53:06,014 --> 00:53:06,958
Speaker 1: continuity which is considered to be the

881
00:53:07,038 --> 00:53:07,580
Speaker 1: outside of the universe?

882
00:53:10,371 --> 00:53:13,546
Speaker 1: Why would there not also be continuity on

883
00:53:13,627 --> 00:53:14,571
Speaker 1: the inside, at the level of interiority?

884
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,546
Speaker 1: Because, as integral philosophy has made us

885
00:53:19,566 --> 00:53:22,079
Speaker 1: aware, universe has an inside and an

886
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:22,300
Speaker 1: outside.

887
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,783
Speaker 1: Matter and energy of the exterior,

888
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:32,319
Speaker 1: subjectivity, interiority, are the inside.

889
00:53:34,149 --> 00:53:35,738
Speaker 1: So if the exterior of the universe has

890
00:53:35,778 --> 00:53:37,565
Speaker 1: continuity, it makes sense that the

891
00:53:37,726 --> 00:53:40,626
Speaker 1: interior of the universe, which is

892
00:53:40,686 --> 00:53:43,355
Speaker 1: interiority itself, is part of that

893
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:46,785
Speaker 1: continuity, that there is continuity in the

894
00:53:46,885 --> 00:53:50,702
Speaker 1: interior of the evolving universe, in the

895
00:53:50,762 --> 00:53:55,743
Speaker 1: inside of the evolving universe, and what

896
00:53:55,763 --> 00:54:00,527
Speaker 1: I've been referring to as the soul, I

897
00:54:00,568 --> 00:54:02,302
Speaker 1: believe, is part and parcel of the

898
00:54:02,343 --> 00:54:08,555
Speaker 1: continuity of that interiority, I believe,

899
00:54:08,595 --> 00:54:09,699
Speaker 1: part and parcel of the continuity of that

900
00:54:09,759 --> 00:54:10,020
Speaker 1: materiality.

901
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,746
Speaker 1: So what I'm calling the soul has been

902
00:54:13,468 --> 00:54:18,903
Speaker 1: present in some partial form from the very

903
00:54:18,943 --> 00:54:19,324
Speaker 1: beginning.

904
00:54:34,461 --> 00:54:35,686
Speaker 1: It's been part of this process for a very

905
00:54:35,726 --> 00:54:36,208
Speaker 1: long time.

906
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,663
Speaker 1: So the soul is the part of us that relates

907
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:58,182
Speaker 1: to the biggest vision of becoming your

908
00:54:58,222 --> 00:55:01,210
Speaker 1: biggest and my biggest glimpse or vision or

909
00:55:01,291 --> 00:55:04,168
Speaker 1: insight into the nature of being part of a

910
00:55:04,188 --> 00:55:05,070
Speaker 1: cosmic process.

911
00:55:06,542 --> 00:55:08,308
Speaker 1: It's been a process for a very long time.

912
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,485
Speaker 1: That's beginning to awaken to itself

913
00:55:10,505 --> 00:55:14,722
Speaker 1: through you, through me, but it's glimpsing

914
00:55:14,782 --> 00:55:21,354
Speaker 1: the significance of being part of this for

915
00:55:21,374 --> 00:55:24,828
Speaker 1: so long, of being inherently meshed in this

916
00:55:24,869 --> 00:55:25,791
Speaker 1: process for so long.

917
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:29,483
Speaker 1: And when you awaken to that and you

918
00:55:29,503 --> 00:55:34,586
Speaker 1: recognize it, it's awe-inspiring and

919
00:55:34,646 --> 00:55:41,624
Speaker 1: overwhelming Because it means we've all

920
00:55:41,645 --> 00:55:42,769
Speaker 1: been here for a very long time.

921
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:44,721
Speaker 1: We just haven't known it.

922
00:55:52,226 --> 00:55:53,947
Speaker 1: So as we wake up to how long we've been

923
00:55:53,988 --> 00:56:05,176
Speaker 1: here, then the self tries to grapple with

924
00:56:05,196 --> 00:56:06,917
Speaker 1: how can I possibly take responsibility for

925
00:56:06,977 --> 00:56:07,317
Speaker 1: all of this?

926
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:14,432
Speaker 1: Who am I if I've been around for all this

927
00:56:14,452 --> 00:56:14,653
Speaker 1: time?

928
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:15,877
Speaker 1: Little old me.

929
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:33,401
Speaker 1: It's enormous, very challenging, daunting,

930
00:56:33,441 --> 00:56:34,284
Speaker 1: very challenging, daunting.

931
00:56:34,304 --> 00:56:35,628
Speaker 1: So how conscious are we to how big all this

932
00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:37,667
Speaker 1: is and how profound it all really is?

933
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:51,784
Speaker 1: The more we can face and come to terms with

934
00:56:51,804 --> 00:56:52,848
Speaker 1: the enormity of this process that we are

935
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:53,772
Speaker 1: inherently a part and parcel of, the more

936
00:56:53,792 --> 00:56:55,198
Speaker 1: profound will be the life that we live and

937
00:56:55,238 --> 00:56:56,300
Speaker 1: our reasons for living it.

938
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:37,626
Speaker 1: Thank you, so your soul, or the soul, can

939
00:57:37,646 --> 00:57:41,233
Speaker 1: see beyond the limitations of this small

940
00:57:41,273 --> 00:57:42,255
Speaker 1: life you're living right.

941
00:57:43,264 --> 00:57:47,581
Speaker 1: I'm not saying your life is small, but the

942
00:57:47,661 --> 00:57:49,122
Speaker 1: limited nature of how we think about what

943
00:57:49,182 --> 00:57:50,003
Speaker 1: it means to be alive.

944
00:58:23,078 --> 00:58:24,238
Speaker 1: The reason why it's so important to

945
00:58:24,258 --> 00:58:25,944
Speaker 1: meditate every day is so that when we have

946
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:30,001
Speaker 1: these glimpses which are often hard when we

947
00:58:30,021 --> 00:58:31,709
Speaker 1: get these glimpses way beyond the narrow

948
00:58:31,749 --> 00:58:37,027
Speaker 1: confines of our ego and its narrow

949
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:40,261
Speaker 1: relationship to personal history, when we

950
00:58:40,281 --> 00:58:43,763
Speaker 1: get these glimpses it widens our

951
00:58:43,803 --> 00:58:48,567
Speaker 1: perspective so much and awakens us to the

952
00:58:48,607 --> 00:58:49,903
Speaker 1: shocking reality of a part of this.

953
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:55,281
Speaker 1: You can see the vast process that

954
00:58:56,843 --> 00:58:59,387
Speaker 1: desperately needs us to be conscious of it.

955
00:59:04,635 --> 00:59:10,798
Speaker 1: Sometimes, when I think in a in a mythic

956
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:15,891
Speaker 1: context, in a mythic, anthropocentric way,

957
00:59:15,931 --> 00:59:17,970
Speaker 1: about the nature of the absolute principle

958
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:20,106
Speaker 1: or the God principle, just for fun,

959
00:59:23,831 --> 00:59:25,477
Speaker 1: sometimes I choose to think about the

960
00:59:25,517 --> 00:59:27,965
Speaker 1: nature of the God principle as an

961
00:59:28,045 --> 00:59:31,467
Speaker 1: anthropomorphic form, just as a

962
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,706
Speaker 1: metaphysical exercise.

963
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:37,645
Speaker 1: So in that context, sometimes I imagine how,

964
00:59:37,725 --> 00:59:42,088
Speaker 1: if I was her, I'm being politically correct.

965
00:59:42,602 --> 00:59:44,140
Speaker 1: Sometimes I imagine, if I was her, how

966
00:59:44,241 --> 00:59:47,072
Speaker 1: desperate I would be for my children to of

967
00:59:47,092 --> 00:59:47,695
Speaker 1: being politically correct.

968
00:59:47,735 --> 00:59:50,023
Speaker 1: Sometimes I imagine, if I was her, how

969
00:59:50,043 --> 00:59:51,688
Speaker 1: desperate I would be for my children to

970
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:57,043
Speaker 1: wake up and to see me, because I knew, as

971
00:59:57,103 --> 00:59:59,623
Speaker 1: long as they could see me there would be

972
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:01,910
Speaker 1: hope for the future.

973
01:00:04,341 --> 01:00:05,786
Speaker 1: And as long as they couldn't really see me

974
01:00:05,826 --> 01:00:08,948
Speaker 1: clearly and feel me and know who I was.

975
01:00:10,541 --> 01:00:13,809
Speaker 1: They would remain lost in delusion.

976
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:25,029
Speaker 1: So that's an anthropocentric contemplation.

977
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,325
Speaker 1: But we don't have to think about it that

978
01:00:26,346 --> 01:00:26,426
Speaker 1: way.

979
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:28,863
Speaker 1: We can say the reality of consciousness is

980
01:00:28,883 --> 01:00:30,564
Speaker 1: desperate for its own self-recognition.

981
01:00:34,709 --> 01:00:42,597
Speaker 1: The same thing, very good.

982
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,066
Speaker 1: So I'm going to stop myself now, but I'm

983
01:00:44,086 --> 01:00:44,748
Speaker 1: kind of rambling.

984
01:00:49,561 --> 01:00:52,910
Speaker 1: So I made the fundamental point I was

985
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:53,692
Speaker 1: trying to make.

986
01:00:53,812 --> 01:00:56,198
Speaker 1: And the fundamental point was that your

987
01:00:56,238 --> 01:01:02,975
Speaker 1: soul and what we're calling the soul, your

988
01:01:02,995 --> 01:01:09,346
Speaker 1: soul, my soul, the soul, its capacity for

989
01:01:09,367 --> 01:01:12,043
Speaker 1: it, identifies with where you're at in

990
01:01:12,064 --> 01:01:14,208
Speaker 1: terms of the stage of development you're at,

991
01:01:14,228 --> 01:01:15,811
Speaker 1: from egocentric, death-centric, to

992
01:01:15,831 --> 01:01:17,054
Speaker 1: world-centric, to cosmos-centric.

993
01:01:17,855 --> 01:01:19,338
Speaker 1: So what your soul will be capable of in

994
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:22,729
Speaker 1: terms of identifying with what's most

995
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:24,195
Speaker 1: important will depend upon which stage of

996
01:01:24,235 --> 01:01:25,480
Speaker 1: development you're at as an evolving

997
01:01:28,161 --> 01:01:28,822
Speaker 1: consciousness.

998
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:04,159
Speaker 1: And remember that the soul is the deepest

999
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:04,660
Speaker 1: part of the self.

1000
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,340
Speaker 1: It's still personal.

1001
01:02:08,027 --> 01:02:09,512
Speaker 1: The ego is purely personal.

1002
01:02:10,968 --> 01:02:13,220
Speaker 1: The frontal self or ego is purely personal.

1003
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:18,952
Speaker 1: So the soul is a much deeper part of who

1004
01:02:18,992 --> 01:02:22,366
Speaker 1: you are and who I am, but it's still

1005
01:02:22,647 --> 01:02:24,151
Speaker 1: personal because it's still about that

1006
01:02:24,191 --> 01:02:27,910
Speaker 1: which experiences birth and death.

1007
01:02:29,761 --> 01:02:31,307
Speaker 1: It's going through a process of change.

1008
01:02:34,861 --> 01:02:37,990
Speaker 1: The true self, your true self and my true

1009
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:39,566
Speaker 1: self is the deepest dimension of who you

1010
01:02:39,626 --> 01:02:41,005
Speaker 1: are, the deepest dimension of your reality

1011
01:02:41,025 --> 01:02:44,047
Speaker 1: self, and it's never born and never dies,

1012
01:02:46,561 --> 01:02:48,165
Speaker 1: and it's therefore eternal and therefore

1013
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:50,632
Speaker 1: has no preferences.

1014
01:02:52,221 --> 01:02:54,682
Speaker 1: So the true self doesn't care, your true

1015
01:02:54,702 --> 01:02:55,425
Speaker 1: self doesn't care.

1016
01:02:56,621 --> 01:02:57,445
Speaker 1: That's why it's free.

1017
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:13,221
Speaker 1: That's why we could say that it might be

1018
01:03:13,241 --> 01:03:15,402
Speaker 1: more important to have an awakened soul

1019
01:03:15,442 --> 01:03:16,403
Speaker 1: than awakening to the true self in which

1020
01:03:16,443 --> 01:03:17,783
Speaker 1: the soul itself has been awakened.

1021
01:03:17,823 --> 01:03:47,578
Speaker 1: Yet I think the most important thing is

1022
01:03:47,638 --> 01:03:49,946
Speaker 1: care, is awakening to deeper and higher

1023
01:03:50,347 --> 01:03:51,511
Speaker 1: capacities for care.

1024
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,168
Speaker 1: I think awakening to deeper and higher

1025
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:57,981
Speaker 1: capacities for care is more important than

1026
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,462
Speaker 1: the experience of inner freedom.

1027
01:04:18,297 --> 01:04:20,719
Speaker 1: Care and awakening to deeper and higher

1028
01:04:20,739 --> 01:04:23,568
Speaker 1: capacity for care can be an enormous burden,

1029
01:04:26,441 --> 01:04:30,883
Speaker 1: because if you care, if you really care, if

1030
01:04:30,903 --> 01:04:32,508
Speaker 1: you allow yourself to care that much and to

1031
01:04:32,548 --> 01:04:33,821
Speaker 1: experience that much care, it means you're

1032
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:35,006
Speaker 1: going to have to do something about it,

1033
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:42,231
Speaker 1: whereas if you are merely free, you don't

1034
01:04:42,271 --> 01:04:42,732
Speaker 1: have to care.

1035
01:04:44,621 --> 01:04:50,162
Speaker 1: So sometimes, paradoxically, the pursuit of

1036
01:04:50,202 --> 01:04:54,661
Speaker 1: freedom for its own sake can be, can

1037
01:04:54,701 --> 01:04:57,703
Speaker 1: inhibit certain kinds of spiritual

1038
01:04:57,724 --> 01:04:58,985
Speaker 1: development, believe it or not.

1039
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:08,974
Speaker 1: Very good.

1040
01:05:08,994 --> 01:05:11,136
Speaker 1: So I'm going to stop talking now and then

1041
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:22,636
Speaker 1: in a couple of minutes I can try and answer

1042
01:05:22,656 --> 01:05:23,638
Speaker 1: some questions if you'd like.

1043
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,618
Speaker 1: Let's hope we all will aspire to become

1044
01:05:28,718 --> 01:05:32,802
Speaker 1: soulful people, soulful of soul, bursting

1045
01:05:32,822 --> 01:05:33,204
Speaker 1: with soul.

1046
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,621
Speaker 1: Soul is care, and care is soul.

1047
01:05:38,641 --> 01:06:17,837
Speaker 1: Thank, you, you.
